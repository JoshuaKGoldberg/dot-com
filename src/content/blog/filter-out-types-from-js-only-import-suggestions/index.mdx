## Problem Statement

[#53339: Filter out types from esm import suggestions in JavaScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/53339) was filed on TypeScript in March of 2023.
It states that at the time, when working in a JavaScript file, TypeScript would still suggest type-only constructs such as `interface`s in `import` statement auto-completions.

Seeing those types in import completion lists is a little inconvenient give that they can't be used in JavaScript file imports.
That's also a little misleading for folks who might be still new to TypeScript and not clear on the difference between type and value spaces.

I figured this would be a fun contribution to get in: filtering out entries from import statements if they're not applicable to the file being imported into.

## Digging Into Completions

My first question was: where do completions come from?

I first looked for resolved issues also tagged as `Domain: Completion Lists` to check for previous pull requests that showed which code areas I'd need to touch.
