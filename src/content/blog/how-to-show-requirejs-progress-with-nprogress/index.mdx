> tl;dr: use the internal [onResourceLoad API](https://github.com/requirejs/requirejs/wiki/Internal-API:-onResourceLoad)

NProgress is an adorable little library that easily makes a smoothly animated loading bar appear on top of a page.
A lot of sites use it to convince the user that loading processes, for example, network requests or IO, will take a small amount of time.

We've all seen logic similar to the following _(like on Medium and GitHub!)_:

```js
// Start showing a progress bar
NProgress.start();

// Make the user think we're continuously making progress
const timer = setInterval(() => NProgress.inc(), 100);

// Send a network request, and when it's done, hide the bar
sendNetworkRequest().then(() => {
	clearInterval(timer);
	NProgress.stop();
	doOtherWork();
});
```

The beauty of the `.inc()` function is that it'll never actually make the bar reach the end.
It's like [Achilles and the Tortoise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes#Achilles_and_the_tortoise) except instead of exploring the mathematical beauty of infinity it makes your users willing to wait for completion.

One drawback of the timer approach is that it assumes the task finishes in a relatively predictable amount of time.
That assumption can fall apart for network requests if the user has a slow connection.
They'll see the progress bar continuously creep to the right while their computer keeps loading… and loading… and eventually the user loses faith in the loading bars altogether.
Sad day.

If you _really_ want to get an accurate loading estimate, a few options are:

- Calculate the user's estimated connection speed based on the average of each request's (data size / time taken)
- Some fancy socket-based data pumping system where the client code controls events for data streams
- On tasks with many network requests, increment your progress bar when each network request completes

The first two are hard.
Let's talk about the third.

RequireJS has an exposed "internal" API called [onResourceLoad](https://github.com/requirejs/requirejs/wiki/Internal-API:-onResourceLoad) that's fired whenever a resource loads.

> "Internal" means it's subject to change at any time.
> Please do be slightly worried about this method eventually changing or becoming deprecated.
> It's very risqué.

Instead of `.inc()`ing on an interval, we can `.inc()` on resource loads.

```js
// Start showing a progress bar
NProgress.start();

// Tell the user whenever we make progress
requirejs.onResourceLoad = () => NProgress.inc());

// Send a network request, and when it's done, hide the bar
sendNetworkRequest().then(() => {
    NProgress.stop();
    delete requirejs.onResourceLoad;
    doOtherWork();
});
```

_Problem: what happens if you have a lot of requests?_

Well, `NProgress.inc()` has no way of knowing how many requests you have overall.
With only a few of them running the loading bar feels reasonable, but when you get into the dozens it starts hanging near the end.
Such scale requires a more intelligent progress bar.

There are again a bunch of ways you could do this.
Optimizing here for page load times with a lot of scripts, we'll want a way to compare how many scripts we've _completed_ against how many have _started_.

RequireJS stores a _"context"_ object for your current user session that contains status for each resource being loaded.
It happens to be the first argument passed to `onResourceLoad`.
All we really need from it is the count of names (_started_ requests).

```js
// Start showing a progress bar
NProgress.start();

// Remember how many resources have been requested
let completed = 0;
let oldPercentage = 0;

// Delay calculations so that if the first of a few resources has many dependencies,
// we don't immediately jump far in the progress bar before starting their loads
requirejs.onResourceLoad = (context) => {
	setTimeout(() => {
		// Don't run this logic if NProgress has finished since it was scheduled
		if (!NProgress.status) {
			return;
		}

		// Tell the user whenever we make progress (only on increased percentages)
		const newPercentage =
			(completed += 1) / Object.keys(context.defined).length;
		if (newPercentage > oldPercentage) {
			NProgress.set(newPercentage);
			oldPercentage = newPercentage;
		}
	}, 100);
};

// Send a network request, and when it's done, hide the bar
sendNetworkRequest().then(() => {
	NProgress.stop();
	delete requirejs.onResourceLoad;
	doOtherWork();
});
```

I've started using variants of these for initial page loads on pages where dependencies aren't all bundled into one script.
They're not exact measurements but they do feel like better representations of overall progress.
