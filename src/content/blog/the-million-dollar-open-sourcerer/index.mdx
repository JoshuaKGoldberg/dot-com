I've been a full time independent open source maintainer for about four years.
Over those years, I missed well over $1,000,000 in potential salary and benefits.

How did I come to that number?
Was it worth it?
Read on.

## Quick Math

In my last full-time job before going independent in open source, I earned $207,000 base salary plus benefits and exercised stock options.
We can approximate that net value to about $350,000 a year.
Adjusting for inflation and yearly raises consistent with past jobs, that number would have raised to about $417k by 2025:

| Year                                                     | Expected Salary | Open Source Salary | Deficit        |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| [2022](/blog/2022-in-review#minimum-wage-in-open-source) | $378,000        | $41,400            | $336,600       |
| [2023](/blog/2023-in-review)                             | $394,000        | $63,700            | $330,300       |
| [2024](/blog/2024-finances-in-review)                    | $405,000        | $60,200            | $344,800       |
| [2025](/blog/2025-finances-in-review)                    | $417,000        | $73,300            | $344,000       |
| Total                                                    | $1,386,000      | ~$238,600          | **$1,355,700** |

### Caveats

This is all vague hand-wavy math.
I might have made less money if I'd been laid off and unable to find as high paying a job.
Or I could have job switched to a job with higher compensation.
We'll never know.

I also want to be clear that I am not complaining.
Employed tech workers in the United States are obscenely overpaid compared to how most other career tracks and regions pay per year of experience.
This post's purpose is to show some cool numbers and surface issues with open source maintenance.

## Why This Is Problematic

TODO (see issue for what I mean)

## Was It Worth It?

For me, yes.

Financially speaking, I have yet to exhaust the savings I accumulated before quitting my job.
This blog post is not a complaint or plea.

I was happy to pay this cost because I wanted to make progress on open source projects that I care about.
I truly believe the initiatives I set out to do -and mostly completed- have benefited the world of web development:

- [create-typescript-app](https://create-typescript-app.dev): consolidated many of the best new tools for general TypeScript projects.
  It helped me identify bugs and feature gaps in many other projects, as well as the need for my own projects such as [Bingo](https://create.bingo) and [OctoGuide](https://octo.guide).
- [typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io): we made significant progress on core rules, [typed linting with the new "project service"](https://typescript-eslint.io/blog/project-service), the revamped website, and more.
- [Flint](https://flint.fyi) & [If I Wrote a Linter](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-4-summary): congealing the learnings I gained from typescript-eslint into opinions on the future of typed linting.
  Even if the Flint project doesn't take off, I've loved seeing other linters reference the post and adopt some ideas.
- Picking up adoption of various size existing projects, such as [Mocha](https://mochajs.org), [eslint-plugin-package-json](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/eslint-plugin-package-json) / [package-json-validator](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/package-json-validator), and [ts-api-utils (tsutils)](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/ts-api-utils)
- Many smaller packages that have some adoption, such as [emoji-blast](https://emojiblast.dev), [formatly](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/formatly), and [TypeStat](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/TypeStat)

## Closing Thoughts / Miscellaneous

Quitting my day job to work on shared projects in the JavaScript/TypeScript/web ecosystem has been incredibly emotionally rewarding, but also challenging.
One of its challenges is financial: there's not a lot of money in the kinds of open source projects I focus on.
If I'd stayed a full-time employee and kept
