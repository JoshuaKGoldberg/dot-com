I like looking back at large time periods and the major events that happened during them.
It's useful to reflect back on what the most important happenings were, and to learn from any missed opportunities or mistakes.
Let's do that now for my 2024.

## Biggest Notes

Out of all that happened in 2023,

### Community Events

I switched from a participant-and-occasional-helper for community events to an active leader in 2024.
2024 saw the launch of two events:

- [Boston TS Club](https://bostonts.club): a monthly meetup for TypeScript developers in the Boston area
- [SquiggleConf](https://squiggleconf.com): _"a conference for excellent web dev tooling"_ held yearly in Boston

I (co-)organized both because I wanted that type of event to regularly occur, and it that wasn't yet.
For both, I'm proud of and thrilled with how far they've come in less than a year.

### Living Wage in Open Source

My earnings this year are pretty similar to [2023 Living Wage in Open Source](./2023-in-review#living-wage-in-open-source).
I took in a total income of roughly **$60,000** for 2024, compared to $63,000 for 2023.

This is ... fine.
Not ideal.
I was hoping to see my income grow, not fall slightly.

> üëâ I broke down my 2024 finances, goals, and hopes for 2025 in [2024 Finances in Review](./2024-finances-in-review)

## Open Source Projects

??? What to put here?

## Year-Long Goals

I'd mentioned yearly goals in [My Plans for 2024](../my-plans-for-2024) last year.
Some of those goals had concrete objectives.
Did I satisfy those objectives?

| Status     | Count | Percentage |
| ---------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Total      | TODO  | _-_        |
| ‚úÖ Hit     | TODO  | TODO%      |
| ‚è≥ Partial | TODO  | TODO%      |
| ‚ùå Miss    | TODO  | TODO%      |

TODO

The following sections go through each of the high-level goals.

## Closing Thoughts

When I worked at Microsoft, I'd occasionally hear a saying that jobs moved in cycles of three years.
The first year you were learning the ropes, the second year you were getting stable, and the third you you finally knew what you're doing.
That's how I feel about being an open source maintainer for three years: I kind of know what I'm doing now.
It's a pleasant surprise.

2024 was a ton of fun, but was very tiring.
I touched on some burnout towards the end and missed some of the big goals I'd had for the year.
I'm happy with what got done but can't help but feeling disappointment that the rest is still pending.

Thanks again to all the awesome people who helped make my 2024 wonderful.
I appreciate you all!
