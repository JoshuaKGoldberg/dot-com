My previous _TypeScript Contribution Diary_ posts were structured as stories explaining the timeline of how those changes made it in.
This entry's pull request had 159 comments over three years -- far too many for that format.
I'll instead give a high-level overview of the backing issue's context, the pull request's strategy, and general code changes.

## Project Scope

There ended up being two areas of source code I had to change:

- [Updating the Type Checker](#updating-the-type-checker): Adjusting TypeScript's type errors to be more lenient
- [Updating Transformers](#updating-transformers): Adjusting output JavaScript for more varieties of constructors

I'll give a high-level overview for each.
I'd strongly recommend referring back to the pull request in your local editor to understand the flow of code.

✨ [#29374: Allowed non-this, non-super code before super call in derived classes with property initializers](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/29374) ✨

Let's dig in! 🎂

---

## Updating the Type Checker

Most use cases for including non`-this`, non-`super` code in the constructor of a derived class are fairly small.
The ones I'd seen in the wild were generally about logging and/or creating a temporary variable to be passed as an argument to the `super()` call.
I also didn't want to spend a great deal of time to handle complicated logical cases.

Thus, I thought it'd be best to tweak TypeScript's type system logic without overhauling it.
Instead of requiring the `super()` call be the _first_ expression in the constructor, I would make two requirements:

- It would need to be a _root-level_ expression: meaning it couldn't be contained in a block such as an `if` or `for`
- Runtime uses of `this` and `super` keywords would not be allowed before that root-level expression

You can see the changes in the pull request's [`src/compiler/checker.ts` file view](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/29374/files#diff-d9ab6589e714c71e657f601cf30ff51dfc607fc98419bf72e04f6b0fa92cc4b8).
These next two blog post sections will give a high-level overview of them.

### Checking for a Root Level `super()`

> [src/compiler/checker.ts#34739](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/29374/files#diff-d9ab6589e714c71e657f601cf30ff51dfc607fc98419bf72e04f6b0fa92cc4b8R34739)

TypeScript's type checker already found the first `super()` call in a constructor using a call to an existing `findFirstSuperCall` function:

```ts
const superCall = findFirstSuperCall(node.body!);
```

That function returns the first node that matches `isSuperCall`, skipping any function boundary and recursively searching through all other child nodes:

```ts
function findFirstSuperCall(node: Node): SuperCall | undefined {
	return isSuperCall(node)
		? node
		: isFunctionLike(node)
			? undefined
			: forEachChild(node, findFirstSuperCall);
}
```

I fortunately didn't need to change `findFirstSuperCall` for my changes.

I used the existing `superCall` variable for a check to make sure it was root level with a new `superCallIsRootLevelInConstructor` function:

```ts
if (!superCallIsRootLevelInConstructor(superCall, node.body!)) {
	error(
		superCall,
		Diagnostics.A_super_call_must_be_a_root_level_statement_within_a_constructor_of_a_derived_class_that_contains_initialized_properties_parameter_properties_or_private_identifiers,
	);
}
```

`superCallIsRootLevelInConstructor` checks whether a `super()` _call expression_'s parent _expression statement_ is in the body of a constructor:

```ts
function superCallIsRootLevelInConstructor(superCall: Node, body: Block) {
	const superCallParent = walkUpParenthesizedExpressions(superCall.parent);
	return (
		isExpressionStatement(superCallParent) && superCallParent.parent === body
	);
}
```

To recap TypeScript's AST behavior around call statements:

- **Block**: Area containing lines of code, commonly surrounded by `{}`
- **Statement**: Line of code, commonly a child of a _block_
  - Examples include _expression statements_, _for statements_, and _if statements_
  - **Expression Statement**: Contains a _call expression_ as its child expression
- **Call Expression**: A call to a function

I find it easier to remember the distinction by recalling that _statements_ may optionally have a semicolon.
In codebases that include semicolons, expression statements contain a child such as a _binary expression_ or _call expression_ plus one character for a semicolon:

```plaintext
super();
|------| <- expression statement
|-----| <- call expression
```

### Checking Constructor Statement Order

> [src/compiler/checker.ts#34754](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/29374/files#diff-d9ab6589e714c71e657f601cf30ff51dfc607fc98419bf72e04f6b0fa92cc4b8R34754)

Next up was making sure nothing in the constructor accessed `super` or `this` before the `super()` call.
I did that with a for loop over the statements in the constructor.
For each statement:

1. If the statement is an expression statement that contains a `super()` call, mark that we found it and break the loop
2. If the statement is a "prologue directive", continue
3. If the statement "immediately" references `super` or `this`, break the loop

```ts
for (const statement of node.body!.statements) {
	if (
		isExpressionStatement(statement) &&
		isSuperCall(skipOuterExpressions(statement.expression))
	) {
		superCallStatement = statement;
		break;
	}

	if (
		!isPrologueDirective(statement) &&
		nodeImmediatelyReferencesSuperOrThis(statement)
	) {
		break;
	}
}
```

After the loop, if we hadn't found the `super()` call, issue a type error with an amusingly long error message for failing to find it.

```ts
if (superCallStatement === undefined) {
	error(
		node,
		Diagnostics.A_super_call_must_be_the_first_statement_in_the_constructor_to_refer_to_super_or_this_when_a_derived_class_contains_initialized_properties_parameter_properties_or_private_identifiers,
	);
}
```

> "A super call must be the first statement in the constructor to refer to super or this when a derived class contains initialized properties parameter properties or private identifiers."

#### Prologue Directives

I had never heard of this term before this pull request.
It refers to string literals used as a statements such as `"use asm;"` and `"use strict";`.
They are by nature allowed to come before any code in a constructor.

In retrospect, I don't recall why I added a special case for them to the function.
Ah well.

> Edit 4/13/2022: The [ECMAScript Spec](https://262.ecma-international.org/5.1/#sec-14.1) refers to them as "Directive Prologues".
> Whoops.

#### Immediately Referencing `super` or `this`

By "immediately" I mean a node accesses `super` or `this` in code that is known to execute immediately, such as children of expressions and blocks.
Another way of putting that is ignoring any code that won't be immediately executed, such as function or property declaration.
There are a lot of edge cases in there!
For example, a class `extends` clause immediately executes the base class being extended, but initial values for properties in any class aren't used in runtime until the constructor for their class is called.

```ts
class Base {}
class Derived extends Base {
	constructor() {
		// class Middle { ... } executes immediately for Inside to extend it...
		class Inside extends class Middle {
			// ...while this property is created later, per-instance
			woweeMiddle = this;
		} {
			// ...while this property is created later, per-instance
			woweeInside = this;
		}

		super();

		new Inside();
	}
}
```

I wrote a `nodeImmediatelyReferencesSuperOrThis` helper function that, similar to `findFirstSuperCall`, recursively checks children of a node.
It stops searching when it encounters a node that creates a new class scope or delays execution of its contents, such as a function or class property.

```ts
function nodeImmediatelyReferencesSuperOrThis(node: Node): boolean {
	if (
		node.kind === SyntaxKind.SuperKeyword ||
		node.kind === SyntaxKind.ThisKeyword
	) {
		return true;
	}

	if (isThisContainerOrFunctionBlock(node)) {
		return false;
	}

	return !!forEachChild(node, nodeImmediatelyReferencesSuperOrThis);
}

/**
 * @returns Whether the node creates a new 'this' scope for its children.
 */
export function isThisContainerOrFunctionBlock(node: Node): boolean {
	switch (node.kind) {
		// Arrow functions use the same scope, but may do
		// so in a "delayed" manner
		// For example, `const getThis = () => this` may be
		// before a super() call in a derived constructor
		case SyntaxKind.ArrowFunction:
		case SyntaxKind.FunctionDeclaration:
		case SyntaxKind.FunctionExpression:
		case SyntaxKind.PropertyDeclaration:
			return true;
		case SyntaxKind.Block:
			switch (node.parent.kind) {
				case SyntaxKind.Constructor:
				case SyntaxKind.MethodDeclaration:
				case SyntaxKind.GetAccessor:
				case SyntaxKind.SetAccessor:
					// Object properties can have computed names;
					// only method-like bodies start a new scope
					return true;
				default:
					return false;
			}
		default:
			return false;
	}
}
```

With these approximate type checker changes, the type checker allows for code before the `super()` call as long as it doesn't immediately reference `super` or `this`.
The type checker was sufficiently updated for my changes.
Hooray!

That leaves us with making TypeScript's code emit properly transform JavaScript for these new constructor variants.

## Updating Transformers

TypeScript's code emit converts input TypeScript syntax to output JavaScript syntax by passing each input AST through a series of transformers.
You can see the impacted transformers in the [pull request](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/29374/files) under `src/transformers`.
They're coordinated by a [`getScriptTransformers` in `src/compiler/transformer.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/39ff1568e9676d40cf545477e9fd04077eff9b78/src/compiler/transformer.ts#L41).

The transformers relevant to this pull request are, in order:

1. **`transformTypeScript`**: Removes type system specific syntax, leaving pure glorious JavaScript.
2. **`transformClassFields`**: Massages class fields such as class properties and parameter properties into their JavaScript equivalents.
3. **`transformES....`**: For each language version recognized by TypeScript, a transformer of the next language version's name transforms it.
   - These start at ESNext, then decrease sequentially from the newest known language version down to the configured output target language version.
   - For example, if the configured output language version is `"es2019"`, then as of TypeScript 4.6 the transformers to be run would be: `transformESNext`, `transformES2021`, and `transformES2020`.

Transformers generally recursively crawl through the nodes in the file's AST, applying transformations to specific node types as they find them.
These next three blog post sections will give a high-level overview of each of the changed transformers.

### `transformTypeScript`

> [src/compiler/transformers/ts.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/29374/files#diff-434a48997b788187774ea0573dd60688d07638fc89e809acf9bb3f455c816027)

`transformTypeScript` includes a `transformConstructorBody` function that turns any parameter properties into assignments within the constructor.

For example, this TypeScript class:

```ts
class HasParameterProperty {
	constructor(public property: number) {
		console.log("Hello, world!");
	}
}
```

...would become this JavaScript class (or the equivalent with `Object.defineProperty` if `useDefineForClassFields` is enabled):

```ts
class HasParameterProperty {
	constructor(property) {
		this.property = property;
		console.log("Hello, world!");
	}
}
```

`transformTypeScript` previously assumed it could add both prologue directives and the initial super call all at once when transforming a constructor with nothing between them.
It did so with a function named `addPrologueDirectivesAndInitialSuperCall` that returned the index of the first statement after them.

I replaced that function with code that computed two important variables:

1. `indexAfterLastPrologueStatement`: After copying any prologue statements, the index of the node just after them
2. `superStatementIndex`: Index of the first found `super()` call after prologue statements, or `-1` if not found

```ts
const indexAfterLastPrologueStatement = factory.copyPrologue(
	body.statements,
	statements,
	/*ensureUseStrict*/ false,
	visitor,
);

const superStatementIndex = findSuperStatementIndex(
	body.statements,
	indexAfterLastPrologueStatement,
);
```

```ts
function findSuperStatementIndex(
	statements: NodeArray<Statement>,
	indexAfterLastPrologueStatement: number,
) {
	for (let i = indexAfterLastPrologueStatement; i < statements.length; i += 1) {
		const statement = statements[i];

		if (getSuperCallFromStatement(statement)) {
			return i;
		}
	}

	return -1;
}
```

Using those two variables, this is the order the code now takes to create the transformed constructor's body in the proper order:

1.  If `superStatementIndex` was found, first visit existing statements up to and including it
2.  Visit any parameter properties and map them into nodes:
    - If `superStatementIndex` was found, place those parameter properties immediately after it
    - If `superStatementIndex` wasn't found, place the parameter properties first in the constructor
3.  Add any remaining statements from the body, skipping the `superStatementIndex` index if it was found

```ts
// If there was a super call, visit existing statements up to and including it
if (superStatementIndex >= 0) {
	addRange(
		statements,
		visitNodes(
			body.statements,
			visitor,
			isStatement,
			indexAfterLastPrologueStatement,
			superStatementIndex + 1 - indexAfterLastPrologueStatement,
		),
	);
}

// Transform parameters into property assignments. Transforms this:
//
//  constructor (public x, public y) {
//  }
//
// Into this:
//
//  constructor (x, y) {
//      this.x = x;
//      this.y = y;
//  }
//
const parameterPropertyAssignments = mapDefined(
	parametersWithPropertyAssignments,
	transformParameterWithPropertyAssignment,
);

// If there is a super() call, the parameter properties go immediately after it
if (superStatementIndex >= 0) {
	addRange(statements, parameterPropertyAssignments);
}
// Since there was no super() call, parameter properties are the first statements in the constructor
else {
	statements = addRange(parameterPropertyAssignments, statements);
}

// Add remaining statements from the body, skipping the super() call if it was found
addRange(
	statements,
	visitNodes(body.statements, visitor, isStatement, superStatementIndex + 1),
);
```

### `transformClassFields`

> [src/compiler/transformers/classFields.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/29374/files#diff-2f470e1718434e5dfb841136a11eda3b4f46e9a2b3d14e0401c64f304da2b87e)

`transformClassFields` also contains a `transformConstructorBody` function.
This time it's used to turn class properties into assignments within the constructor.

For example, this TypeScript class:

```ts
class HasClassProperty {
	property = 1;
	constructor() {
		console.log("Hello, world!");
	}
}
```

...would become this JavaScript class (or the equivalent with `Object.defineProperty` if `useDefineForClassFields` is enabled):

```ts
class HasClassProperty {
	constructor() {
		this.property = 1;
		console.log("Hello, world!");
	}
}
```

This `transformConstructorBody` also inserts a "synthetic" `super(...arguments)` if the class is a derived one with a property initializer and without its own constructor.

For example, this TypeScript class:

```ts
class HasJustClassProperty {
	property = 1;
}
```

...needs to create its own `constructor` and `super(...arguments)` in order to hold the mapped property in its output JavaScript:

```js
class HasJustClassProperty {
	constructor() {
		super(...arguments);
		this.property = 1;
	}
}
```

In order to account for code being emitted before any class properties and any constructor, the logic is roughly:

1. Map any prologue directives and explicit `super()` call into the new constructor
2. If there was a `super()` call, splice any statements preceding it after the prologue statements and before the `super()` call
3. Later depending on whether a `super()` call was found:
   - If it was, add parameter properties immediately after it
   - If it wasn't but a synthetic `super(...arguments)` was added, add those parameter properties just after it
   - If neither is the case, add those parameter properties to the top of the constructor

Ordering is tricky!

I also excluded parameter properties from being moved into the constructor when `useDefineForClassFields` is enabled, as those properties are then handled elsewhere.
I don't remember where else they're handled but I do remember that when I didn't filter them out, they appeared twice in the output JavaScript.

### `transformES2015`

> [src/transformers/es2015.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/29374/files#diff-dcd4349c3d05901caf249656675e87a417abb13c0c678026b823e8a259442c34)

The ES2015-to-ES5 transformer is the largest of TypeScript's transformers and contains more lines of code than all the other ECMAScript transformers combined.
I suggested in [#47573: Remove older emit support over time](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/47573) that TypeScript no longer target ECMAScript versions older than what any realistically used runtime environment needs...
but until dropping pre-ES2020 happens some years in the future (🙏), ES2015 classes still need to be transformed into function `prototype` equivalents in TypeScript's compiled output JavaScript.

This TypeScript class:

```ts
class HasPropertyAndLog {
	message = "world";

	constructor() {
		console.log("Hello", this.message);
	}
}
```

...becomes roughly this output JavaScript:

```js
var HasPropertyAndLog = /** @class */ (function () {
	function HasPropertyAndLog() {
		this.message = "world";
		console.log("Hello", this.message);
	}
	return HasPropertyAndLog;
})();
```

`transformES2015`'s `transformConstructorBody` keeps track of two arrays of statement nodes:

- `prologue`: Any existing prologue directives, as well as any nodes added during transformation meant to be added just after them
- `statements`: The rest of the statements output for the function body

My change started off by adding three pieces of logic:

1. Captures any previously existing prologue directives in an `existingPrologue` array
2. Find the `super()` call, storing it in a `superCall` and its statement index in `superStatementIndex`
   - This is done with a new `findSuperCallAndStatementIndex` that loops through constructor body statements after those in `existingPrologue`
3. Create a `postSuperStatementsStart` variable to determine where post-`er(...)` nodes are meant to be placed:
   - If a `super()` call wasn't found, place them just after `existingPrologue`
   - If a `super()` call was found, place them just after `superStatementIndex`

`transformConstructorBody` is then able to use that information to create constructor body statements:

1. If the `super()` call wasn't synthesized, copy prologue statements into `prologue`
2. Create a `superCallExpression` variable to store a new `super()` call, if a previous one exists:
   - If the existing `super()` is synthesized, replace it with the ES5 equivalent: `var _this = _super !== null && _super.apply(this, arguments) || this;`
   - If the existing `super()` wasn't synthesized, store the result of visiting it
3. Add any default property value assignments and constructor rest parameter to the end of `prologue`
4. Add any remaining statements from the constructor to `statements`

The logic for where to place that `superCallExpression` node changes based on a few potential cases commented in [src/compiler/transformers/es2015.ts#1056](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/29374/files#diff-dcd4349c3d05901caf249656675e87a417abb13c0c678026b823e8a259442c34R1056):

- Whether the constructor is in a derived class
  - If so, whether the constructor ends with a `super()` call and doesn't refer to `this`
- Whether the `super()` call, if it exists, is the first call in the constructor

> I've omitted code snippets from this transformer's explanation for brevity.

I know that was a big wall of text, but if you read through the contents of `transformConstructorBody` and use its comments as reference, I think it can be reasoned through.
The transformer code has to include a few extra function calls to properly massage `this` scoping and source maps from ES2015+ classes to ES5 functions here and there.
