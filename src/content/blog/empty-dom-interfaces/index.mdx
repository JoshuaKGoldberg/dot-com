## Problem Statement

TypeScript's `tsconfig.json` compiler options allow us to specify what global type definitions to compile with.
They default to the built-in `"dom"` typings as well as whatever your `"target"` compiler option specifies:

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		// implicit:
		// "lib": ["dom", "es2018"],
		"target": "es2018"
	}
}
```

You might, for example, ask to have `"dom"` and `"es2018"` global types included regardless of your _target_:

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"lib": ["dom", "es2018"]
	}
}
```

These get a little tricky.
`"dom"` is included in the default settings when you don't specify your own `"lib"`, but not if you specify a custom one without it.
If you don't include `"dom"` in the list, type definitions for global DOM elements such as `HTMLElement` won't be included.

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		// DOM types won't be included by default now!
		"lib": ["es2018"]
	}
}
```

Most projects for code that run in the browser will generally want to include `"dom"`.
_Not_ including `"dom"` makes sense for projects that execute in a context without the DOM, such as Deno or Node.
You wouldn't want someone thinking they have access to global values such as `document` if they might not exist.

Some library typings -including the ever-popular `@types/react`- include stub interfaces so that they can be included in non-DOM projects and still refer to those element types.

```ts
interface Element {}
interface DocumentFragment {}

interface HTMLElement extends Element {}
interface HTMLAnchorElement extends HTMLElement {}
```

Per [TypeScript issue #33907 Give better error messages when properties are accessed on global empty DOM interfaces](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/33907) and its [referenced Tweet](https://twitter.com/rauschma/status/1181852019264503808) it would sure be nice to have a better error message in TypeScript for the case of a developer trying to access a member of an object of one of those blank types!

```ts
function logElementContent(element: HTMLElement) {
	console.log(element.textContent);
	//                  ~~~~~~~~~~~
	// Property 'textContent' does not exist on type 'HTMLElement'.
	// Did you forget to include "dom" in your "lib" setting?
}
```

### Prior Work

Turns out a Kyle Lin ([@kylejlin](https://github.com/kylejlin)) had already started a solution to [#33907](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/33907): [PR #34407 Improve error messages for empty DOM interface property access](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/34407).

It worked in the following manner:

1. Whenever the `Property '{0}' does not exist on type '{1}'.` diagnostic message _would_ be logged:
2. If the containing type seemed to be an empty DOM interface per an `isEmptyDomInterface` function,
3. Use the new diagnostic message that adds _`"Try changing the 'lib' compiler option to include 'dom'."`_.

```ts
function isEmptyDomInterface(type: Type): boolean {
	return (
		isEmptyObjectType(type) &&
		/\bHTML\w*Element\b(?![:"])/.test(typeToString(type))
	);
}
```

I tried out that branch locally and ran it on some violating code.

```ts
interface HTMLInputElement {}

let element: HTMLInputElement;

element.textContent;
//      ~~~~~~~~~~~
// Property 'textContent' does not exist on type 'HTMLInputElement'. Try changing the `lib` compiler option to include 'dom'.
```

Looks like it already worked great!
Thanks Kyle!

### Prior Feedback

Kyle's PR had been given feedback but never addressed it before aging away.
The main changes requested were around that `isEmptyDomInterface` function:

- Rewriting to not use a regular expression
- Using `type.symbol.escapedName` instead of the more expensive `typeToString`

I really wanted this error message improvement.
Time for me to dig in! ðŸ’ª

## A New PR

### Compiler Options

Looking over the original PR, I noticed that the `isEmptyDomInterface` function didn't check what the compiler options for `lib` were specified as.
I figured it'd be a good idea to add in logic to restrict the new error message on the off chance that someone with `"dom"` in their `lib` was making their own custom interfaces that happened to match the name matching.

Question: how to check compiler options in `checker.ts`?

I ran a text search for _`compiler.*options`_ in the file and found a bunch of references to a `compilerOptions` object.
Good good.

```ts
function isEmptyDomInterface(type: Type): boolean {
    return (
        compilerOptions.lib &&
        !compilerOptions.lib.includes("dom") &&
        // ...
    );
}
```

### Union and Intersection Types

The original PR used a `typeToString` method to convert the original container type's name to a usable string, but
I was worried that that strategy was inefficient and/or didn't work at all for union and intersection types.
For example, this type should still trigger the complaint, even though its name string is complex:

```ts
interface HTMLAreaElement {}
interface HTMLAudioElement {}
interface HTMLBaseElement {}

let element: HTMLAreaElement | (HTMLAudioElement & HTMLBaseElement);

element.textContent;
```

I ran some text searches for names like _`every.*type`_ and didn't see any existing utility function to check that every contained type in a union or intersection matches a function.
So I wrote my own:

```ts
function everyContainedType(type: Type, f: (t: Type) => boolean): boolean {
	return type.flags & TypeFlags.UnionOrIntersection
		? every((type as UnionOrIntersectionType).types, f)
		: f(type);
}
```

Now that I was testing against individual type names, I simplified the regular expression a bit:

{/* spell-checker: disable */}

```ts
function containerSeemstoBeEmptyDomElement(containingType: Type): boolean {
	return (
		compilerOptions.lib &&
		!compilerOptions.lib.includes("dom") &&
		everyContainedType(
			containingType,
			(type) =>
				type.symbol &&
				/^(EventTarget|Node|((HTML[a-zA-Z]*)?Element))$/.test(
					type.symbol.escapedName.toString()
				)
		) &&
		checker.getPropertiesOfType(containingType).length === 0
	);
}
```

{/* spell-checker: enable */}

### Asking Questions

Comparing my notes to how the original PR implemented empty element detection, I wasn't sure what the best way to determine whether an element is empty.
The original PR used `isEmptyObjectType` but I'd previously seen a `getPropertiesOfType` function and used it in my own function.

I also didn't understand the request to not use a regular expression.
It seemed reasonable to me that we'd use some kind of string-based logic to detect names matching `HTML*Element`.

I [sent a new PR](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/43007) and [asked about the regular expressions and empty object detection](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/43007#discussion_r584429414).

## Peer Reviews

### Naming

The first review feedback I got was pretty easy to resolve.
Do you see the difference?

{/* spell-checker: disable */}

```diff
- containerSeemstoBeEmptyDomElement(containingType)
+ containerSeemsToBeEmptyDomElement(containingType)
```

{/* spell-checker: enable */}

ðŸ¤¦.

### Getting Answers

The [responses](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/43007/files/3e595a5f6baac097780e6ecb3d23ec9869d6dd4d#r598024356) to my questions were pretty straightforward:

- Using a regular expression is fine; the original PR's one was just a bit more complicated than it needed to be
- `isEmptyObjectType` is the right way in this situation to check for an empty object type

It was [also mentioned](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/43007/files/3e595a5f6baac097780e6ecb3d23ec9869d6dd4d#r598024721) that I didn't need to call `toString()` on `type.symbol.escapedName`, since that's already a string.

> TypeScript uses a `__String` type internally to refer to strings whose leading underscore have been escaped by adding extra leading underscores.
> See the [Basarat article on Nominal Typing](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/main-1/nominaltyping#using-interfaces) for more details.

I used `unescapeLeadingUnderscores` for Ultimate Correctness to sanitize that string.

Applying all the feedback:

```ts
function containerSeemsToBeEmptyDomElement(containingType: Type): boolean {
	return (
		compilerOptions.lib &&
		!compilerOptions.lib.includes("dom") &&
		everyContainedType(
			containingType,
			(type) =>
				type.symbol &&
				/^(EventTarget|Node|((HTML[a-zA-Z]*)?Element))$/.test(
					unescapeLeadingUnderscores(type.symbol.escapedName)
				)
		) &&
		isEmptyObjectType(containingType)
	);
}
```

### Diagnostic Messages Quotes

The original proposed diagnostic message addition looked like this:

```json
"... Try changing the `lib` compiler option to include 'dom'."
```

One [piece of feedback](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/43007/files/3e595a5f6baac097780e6ecb3d23ec9869d6dd4d#r585149336) requested using a consistent quoting style.
It was noted that other diagnostic messages don't have a consistent style; for now, we went with single quotes consistently.

```json
"... Try changing the 'lib' compiler option to include 'dom'."
```

[#43503 Error messages inconsistently use backticks and single quotes](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/43503) was filed to later resolve the general inconsistencies.

## Wrapping Up

I pushed the requested adjustments in the PR and re-requested review.
It was merged in within a day.
Yay! ðŸŽ‰

## Regular Expressions, Explained

Regular expressions can be tough to read if you're not familiar with the syntax!
A regular expression, or "regexp" for short, is a description of what characters to check for, in order, from a string.

I like the [MDN Regular Expressions article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions); the [Codecademy Learn the Basics of Regular Expressions course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-regular-expressions) is a solid intro if you want to be more hands-on and guided.

### My Regular Expression

```js
/^(EventTarget|Node|((HTML[a-zA-Z]*)?Element))$/;
```

First off, `^` indicates the _beginning_ of a string and `$` indicates the _end_ of a string.
Using them at the beginning and end of the regular expression means this will only match an _entire_ string: not a partial subset.
For this regexp or a simpler one like `^Node$`, `BlahNodeBlah` doesn't match but `Node` does.

Next, this regular expression shows off [groups and ranges](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Groups_and_Ranges).
The `|` pipes indicate that the content must be _any_ of:

- `EventTarget`
- `Node`
- `(HTML[a-zA-Z]*)?Element`

That last one is what matches `Element`, `HTMLElement`, and all other names such as `HTMLAudioElement` that have characters between `HTML` and `Element`:

- `[a-zA-Z]` indicates we can have any character in the alphabet between `a-z` or `A-Z`
- `*` indicates we want the previous character _(here, the alphabet ones)_ to be allowed to repeat >=0 times
- The `?` in that last option means anything before it is optional

Putting them all together, this regular expression is another way of testing for the name `EventTarget`, `Node`, `Element`, `HTMLElement`, or `HTML` + (some alphabet characters) + `Element`.

### The Original Regular Expression

```ts
/\bHTML\w*Element\b(?![:"])/;
```

- Per [MDN's Assertions article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Assertions), `\b` matches a word boundary
- Per [MDN's Character Classes article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Character_Classes), `\w` matches any alphanumeric character from the basic Latin alphabet, including the underscore.
- `?!` is another assertion: it matches only if the following characters are _not_ what comes next in the string.

Putting them all together, this was another way of testing that the type has, in order:

1. `HTML`
2. Any number of alphabetical characters
3. `Element`
4. _Not_ `:` or `"` at the end
