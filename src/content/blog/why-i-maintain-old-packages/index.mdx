## Maintaining Old Projects

Over the last couple of years, I've taken on maintenance of several older projects that are no longer undergoing active feature development:

- [dedent](https://github.com/dmnd/dedent/issues/36): May 2023
- [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/5027): November 2023, along with other maintainers
- [Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/1779): January 2025, along with other maintainers

> Other projects I've taken on such as [eslint-plugin-expect-type](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/eslint-plugin-expect-type) and [package-json-validator](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/package-json-validator) are still under active feature development, and so aren't the focus of this blog post.

For each of those projects, I posted an issue explaining the project maintenance goals to be focused on stability.
None are undergoing active feature development anymore.
They're just treading water with docs fixes, dependency upgrades, and regular triaging and reviewing of user issues and pull requests.

I bellow at the start of each year about how I want to advance the state of web development, push forward TypeScript tooling, and other grandiose ideals.
So why would I spend my limited time on these old projects -- especially considering how many modern projects could use work themselves?

Well, there are a few reasons...

## It's Impactful

These projects might not be pushing the ecosystem forward, but they're still used by many, many people.
The [`dedent` package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dedent) is downloaded over 10 million times a week.
Mocha is the test runner for many major ecosystem projects including ESLint and TypeScript.
Yeoman is the core driver in the [VS Code Your First Extension guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension).

These projects are used by real developers.
Keeping them afloat helps those developers.
Even if "afloat" just means removing a few npm warnings about deprecated dependencies, I think this work is beneficial.

The JavaScript ecosystem has a reputation for moving fast and tools getting outdated quickly.
When major projects that used to be popular only a few years ago crumble, that tarnishes the experience and reputation of the ecosystem.
Keeping older projects reasonably functional helps stave off that bad reputation.

## It's Interesting

On a personal level, I find these projects fascinating to dig into.
Especially the larger ones with over a decade of context to sift through.
Going back through the issue trackers and pull requests shows a deep history of project decisions and personal politics.

I learn a lot
The historical dives are fascinating

### It's Satisfying

I love organizing and tidying up.
I'm like a digital Marie Kondo, except instead of arranging bookshelves and tabletops, I sort properties alphabetically and apply meaningful labels.

Being able to go through a project backlog from years of disrepair is...
Well, it's like a seven-year-old being given a fresh sheet of bubble wrap.
I love it.

To start, a big percentage of issues end up being duplicates of others.
This happens even in well-groomed open source backlogs -- let alone ones without proper labeling.

Plus, most older projects hail from before proper GitHub issue label practices were solidified.
Most don't have labels for area, status, or type -- if they have labels at all.

The juiciest bit is that when a project switches from active feature development to long-term stability, a lot of feature requests become out of scope.
Which means the new maintainer -me!- gets to close all those issues.

For reference, the Mocha organization backlog had over 400 open issues towards the end of 2023.
It now has fewer than 200.

The pure feeling of satisfaction from labeling hundreds of issues and wontfix-ing dozens of them is itself almost reward enough for doing the work.
Almost, except...

## The Money Is Nice Too

I'm a full time independent open source maintainer.
Income from open source projects is how I support myself.
These older projects generally have funding available, which I then receive some or all of as a maintainer.

I used to feel awkward, even embarrassed, about receiving compensation for my work on shared open source projects.
I don't like the idea of monetary motivations influencing open source development.

But, being paid for labor is good, actually.
I earned $60k in 2024, my third year of full time open source.
My time is valuable and working on these projects is valuable labor.
