title: Binary Arithmetic in the TypeScript Type System
---

_(updated 10/19 with typo fixes)_

## Preamble

Throughout the tech stacks and projects you could work on, the idea of a _language_ is constant.
Language describes how reality should be.

JavaScript describes how to create objects and manipulate them in an environment such as a browser, Node, or Deno.
TypeScript contains that JavaScript language _and_ a types language to describe the shapes your objects an be.

Take this `Movie` description:

```ts
type Movie = {
	name: string;
	rating: number;
};
```

We're declaring in the TypeScript type system that all "Movie" objects must have two properties:

- A `name` property of type `string`
- A `rating` property of type `number`

This TypeScript snippet contains JavaScript code declaring the creation of a `movie` variable and type system code declaring the type of that variable to be `Movie`:

```ts
const movie: Movie = {
	name: "This is Spinal Tap",
	rating: 11,
};
```

Cool.

The type system can also represent _"it's one of these"_ (_union_) types such as this `RawId`:

```ts
type RawId = number | string;
```

Anything of type RawId may be either a `number` _or_ a `string`.
In this snippet, the `id` variable is happy as either of those:

```ts
let id: RawId;

id = 123;
id = "abc";
```

...but if we give it something else, the type system complains:

```ts
// Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'RawId'
id = false;
```

Also cool.

## Goals

The end goal of this rant is to implement binary arithmetic in the TypeScript type system.
That means we'll have to:

1. Create types representing computer **bits**
2. Create types representing **operations** performed on those bits
3. Perform **fancy** operations on those types

## Bits

To start:

```ts
type Bit = 0 | 1;
```

Variables of type `Bit` can be _either_ the number `0` or the number `1`.

Given a `myBit` variable declared of type `Bit`, these values are fine:

```ts
let bit: Bit;

bit = 0;
bit = 1;
```

...but, as with the `id` variable above, values not of type `Bit` (`0` or `1`) are not allowed:

```ts
// Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'Bit'.
myBit = 2;
myBit = 1 + 1;
```

### Bit Values

We can also represent the more specific bit values of `0` and `1` within the type system.
Just as we declared a general `Bit` type to represent anything that's either of those, we can declare types to be those specific values:

```ts
type BitZero = 0;
type BitOne = 1;
```

Those types exist only within the type system.
If you wanted to think of the operations we're running here as having equivalents in plain old JavaScript, the equivalent would be:

```js
const BitZero = 0;
const BitOne = 1;
```

## Generic Types

In some cases we'll want to describe a new type based off a previous type.

```ts
type BitFlip<T> = T extends 0 ? 1 : 0;
```

This `BitFlip` type is a _generic_, or _templated_ type.

- If the original type `T` is `0`, then the new type is `1`.
- Otherwise, the new type is `0`.

We'll use "extends" as a sort-of-equal operator.
_(It's more of a "can be described by" operator.)_

Given a usage of `BitFlip`, we can clue in to what it'll result in by filling in the code:

1. `type BitOne = BitFlip<0>;`
2. `type BitOne = 0 extends 0 ? 1 : 0;`
3. `type BitOne = 1;`

### Type Phrasing

Another way of looking at the these types could be to translate them to functional TypeScript code.
If a generic type takes in a previous type, then we can consider those equivalent to arguments passed to a function.
The new type could be the returned value from that function.

```ts
function BitFlip(T) {
	return T === 0 ? 1 : 0;
}
```

Voila!
Subsequent examples here will come with both the type system and traditional code variants.

## Type Safety

Problem: how do we restrict the input types... of our `type`s?

Suppose someone passes an invalid template type to `BitFlip`:

```ts
// We probably want some kind of type// system complaint, right?
type Wat = BitFlip<"Nope">;
```

Types allow '`extends`' with generics to limit what you're allowed to give them.
If we add an `extends Bit` to the `BitFlip`'s `T`:

```ts
type BitFlip<T extends Bit> = T extends 0 ? 1 : 0;
```

...we'll be told by the type system when we pass the wrong types in:

```ts
// Type '"Nope"' does not satisfy the constraint 'Bit'.
type Wat = BitFlip<"Nope">;
```

That's the equivalent of adding a parameter type declaration to a regular function.

```ts
function BitFlip(T: Bit) {
	return T === 0 ? 1 : 0;
}
```

## Tuple Types!

Generics can take in multiple templated types.
Each is allowed its own `extends` clause.

Even better, we can perform operations such as `extends` on "tuple" types, which are fixed-length arrays containing types at specific indices:

```ts
type BitAnd<A extends Bit, B extends Bit> = [A, B] extends [1, 1] ? 1 : 0;
```

In other words, the `BitAnd` type takes in two bits: `A` and `B`.
If `[A, B]` is `[1, 1]` (so both `A` and `B` are `1`), then the resultant type is `1`.
In any other case the resultant type is `0`.

```ts
function BitAnd(A: Bit, B: Bit) {
	return A === 1 && B === 1 ? 1 : 0;
}
```

In _other_ other words, the returned type is `1` if both `A` and `B` are, and `0` otherwise.

## Bit Addition

We're getting closer to binary arithmetic!
First: how do you add two bits (`0 | 1`)?

- If both are `0`, the sum is `0`.
- If one is `0` and the other is `1`, the sum is `1`.
- If both are `1`, the sum is `0`, with a `1` carried over to the next bit.

Let's show that in code:

```ts
// Output: [Sum, Carry]
type BitAdd<A extends Bit, B extends Bit> = [A, B] extends [0, 0]
	? [0, 0]
	: [A, B] extends [1, 0] | [0, 1]
	? [1, 0]
	: [0, 1];
```

Wowee.

Amusingly, the type system version of `BitAdd` is a little bit more concise than its JavaScript equivalent:

```js
function BitAdd(A: Bit, B: Bit) {
	if (A === 0 && B === 0) return [0, 0];
	if (A === 0 && B === 1) return [1, 0];
	if (A === 1 && B === 0) return [0, 1];
	return [0, 1];
}
```

## Introducing Integers

An ‚Äúeight bit integer‚Äù is an integer value represented using... eight bits!

The value of an `Int8` is the sum of its bits, where each bit contributes twice as much as the previous to the total.

- If all bits are `0`, the value is `0`.
- If the first bit is `1`, the value is `1`.
- If the second bit is `1`, the value is `2`.
- If the first and second bits are `1`, the value is `1+2 = 3`.
- If the third bit is `1`, the value is `4`.

```ts
type Int8 = [Bit, Bit, Bit, Bit, Bit, Bit, Bit, Bit];
```

Tada! üéâ

```ts
type Zero = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
type One = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
type Two = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
type Three = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
type Four = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
// ...and so on...
```

It's getting tedious to type out these values using all 8 bits manually.
There's an easier way to generate them...

## Mapped Types

A "mapped type" is one that transforms the properties of some input type. It... maps them!
I want to make a "ZeroOut" helper that takes in an original array of bits and converts all its values to 0.

```ts
type ZeroOut<Ints extends Bit[]> = {
	[Index in keyof Ints]: 0;
};
```

Seen in JavaScript:

```js
function ZeroOut(Ints: Bit[]) {
	return Ints.map(() => 0);
}
```

`Array#map` and our mapped types come from the same term ‚Äì to _map_ from one type to another.
_Map!_

### More Mapping

Taking mapped types one step further, we can replace just a subset of an original type.
This mapped type uses conditional logic to swap out some bits from an original, input array of bits.

```ts
type ReplaceBits<Bits extends Bit[], Replacements extends Bit[]> = {
	[Index in keyof Bits]: Index extends keyof Replacements
		? Replacements[Index]
		: Bits[Index];
};
```

Running through the logic in order:

1. `Bits` and `Replacements` are input types, both of which must be describable as `Bit[]`s
2. The resultant type maps over the `Index`ed values in `Bits`
3. Each of the new, mapped values is one of two things:
   1. If the `Index` exists in the `Replacements` array, we'll use that (replacing) value
   2. If not, use the original value under `Bits[Index]`

```ts
type One = ReplaceBits<Zero, [1]>; // [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
type Two = ReplaceBits<Zero, [0, 1]>; // [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
type Three = ReplaceBits<Zero, [1, 1]>; // [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

In JavaScript:

```js
function ReplaceBits(Bits: Bit[], Replacements: Bit[]) {
	return Bits.map((Original, Index) => {
		return Index in Object.keys(Replacements) ? Replacements[Index] : Original;
	});
}
```

## Addition with Bits

As with decimal (10) based addition, numbers overflow as ‚Äúcarries‚Äù to the next column.
Since this is binary, you can overflow a 1.

Suppose you wanted to add `110` to `111`.

- The smallest bit (index 0) is `0 + 1 = 1`, with nothing carried over
- The index 1 bit is `1 + 1 = 0`, with `1` carried over
- The index 2 bit is `1 + 1 + 1` because of that `1` carried over, making it `1` with another `1` carried over
- The index 3 bit is `1` from being carried over

`110 + 111 = 1101`.

Representing each column's three bits of addition in the type system:

```ts
//¬†Output:¬†[Sum,¬†Carry]
type BitAddThree<A extends Bit, B extends Bit, C extends Bit> = [
	A,
	B,
	C,
] extends [0, 0, 0]
	? [0, 0]
	: [A, B, C] extends [1, 0, 0] | [0, 1, 0] | [0, 0, 1]
	? [1, 0]
	: [A, B, C] extends [1, 1, 0] | [1, 0, 1] | [0, 1, 1]
	? [0, 1]
	: [1, 1];
```

If you think that's a mouthful, take a look at the JavaScript equivalent:

```js
function BitAddThree(A: Bit, B: Bit, C: Bit) {
	if (A === 0 && B === 0 && C === 0) return [0, 0];
	if (
		(A === 1 && B === 0 && C === 0) ||
		(A === 0 && B === 1 && C === 0) ||
		(A === 0 && B === 0 && C === 1)
	)
		return [1, 0];
	if (
		(A === 1 && B === 1 && C === 0) ||
		(A === 1 && B === 0 && C === 1) ||
		(A === 0 && B === 1 && C === 1)
	)
		return [0, 1];
	return [1, 1];
}
```

## Getting Ready to Rock! ü§ò

...how do we set up bit adds of all columns in our input binary?

Also, adding eight bits together means we might have to carry a bit from index `0` to `1`, then from index `1` to `2`, etc. all the way to the last bit.

...how do we store variables in our types?

### Helper: Get [Sum, Carry]s of Two Int8s

In theory, we could add our bit columns together by mapping the known shared keys from them, `0` through `8`, to the `BitAdd` of the those two bits.

```ts
// Output: [[Sum, Carry], [Sum, Carry], [Sum, Carry], ...]
type BitAdds<A extends Int8, B extends Int8> = {
	[P in 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7]: BitAdd<A[P], B[P]>;
};
```

Seeing this in JavaScript, it's a little cleaner:

```js
function BitAdds(A: Int8, B: Int8) {
	return [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].map((P) => BitAdd(A[P], B[P]));
}
```

_(this utility isn't necessary for the final result - it's just cool)_

### Generic Parameter Defaults

We'll use a quirk of generics to store variables within a type.

```ts
type ContrivedExample<
	A extends Bit,
	B extends Bit,
	C extends BitAnd<A, B> = BitAnd<A, B>,
> = [A, B, C];
```

The `C` generic is the equivalent of a variable:

- We restrict it to the `BitAnd<A, B>` type with `extends`
- and if not provided, it defaults to `BitAnd<A, B>` with `=`

Tl;dr: `C = BitAnd<A, B>`.

## We're Almost Ready!

So exciting!
We're _almost_ ready to implement 8 bit integer additions in the type system.

Before we get into the TypeScript implementation, here's the JavaScript equivalent for reference:

```js
function Int8Add(A: Int8, B: Int8) {
	// Grab the Sum and Carry for the result's first bit
	const At0 = BitAdd(A[0], B[0]);

	// The result at each index is the Sum from that index + the previous Carry.
	const At1 = BitAddThree(A[1], B[1], At0[1]);
	const At2 = BitAddThree(A[2], B[2], At1[1]);
	const At3 = BitAddThree(A[3], B[3], At2[1]);
	const At4 = BitAddThree(A[4], B[4], At3[1]);
	const At5 = BitAddThree(A[5], B[5], At4[1]);
	const At6 = BitAddThree(A[6], B[6], At5[1]);
	const At7 = BitAddThree(A[7], B[7], At6[1]);

	return [At0[0], At1[0], At2[0], At3[0], At4[0], At5[0], At6[0], At7[0]];
}
```

...and now, 8 bit binary arithmetic in the TypeScript type system! ‚ú®

```ts
type Int8Add<
	A extends Int8,
	B extends Int8,
	// Grab the Sum and Carry for the result's first bit
	At0 extends BitAdd<A[0], B[0]> = BitAdd<A[0], B[0]>,
	// The result at each index is the Sum from that index + the previous Carry.
	At1 extends BitAddThree<A[1], B[1], At0[1]> = BitAddThree<A[1], B[1], At0[1]>,
	At2 extends BitAddThree<A[2], B[2], At1[1]> = BitAddThree<A[2], B[2], At1[1]>,
	At3 extends BitAddThree<A[3], B[3], At2[1]> = BitAddThree<A[3], B[3], At2[1]>,
	At4 extends BitAddThree<A[4], B[4], At3[1]> = BitAddThree<A[4], B[4], At3[1]>,
	At5 extends BitAddThree<A[5], B[5], At4[1]> = BitAddThree<A[5], B[5], At4[1]>,
	At6 extends BitAddThree<A[6], B[6], At5[1]> = BitAddThree<A[6], B[6], At5[1]>,
	At7 extends BitAddThree<A[7], B[7], At6[1]> = BitAddThree<A[7], B[7], At6[1]>,
> = [At0[0], At1[0], At2[0], At3[0], At4[0], At5[0], At6[0], At7[0]];
```

We did it!
