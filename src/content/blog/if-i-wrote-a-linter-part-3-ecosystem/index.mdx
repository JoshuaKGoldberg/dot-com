## Consistent Glossary

Most developers I've talked to do not understand or use the right terms when talking about linting.
Heck, most developers don't want to talk about the linter in the first place -- let alone understand the difference between, say, a config and a plugin.

Many important linting terms have inconsistent usage or even definitions in the wild today.
For example, _"stylistic"_ can alternately refer to:

- [Stylistic (Rule)](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/core-concepts/glossary#stylistic-rule): The category of lint rules that enforce _formatting_, naming conventions, or consistent usage of equivalent syntaxes
- [ESLint Stylistic](https://eslint.style): The plugin that ESLint's _formatting_ rules were migrated to, along with a small selection of non-formatting stylistic rules
- [typescript-eslint's stylistic shared configs](https://typescript-eslint.io/users/configs#stylistic), which enforce consistent usage of equivalent syntaxes, as well as general TypeScript best practices that don't impact program logic

...what!?

I work on linters and I have a hard time keeping this all straight.

The [ESLint Glossary](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/core-concepts/glossary) is a very good first step towards solidifying terminology.
I would want to go one step further and have a single term and definition for all the linting concepts that authors and/or end users care about.
Doing so would provide authors with the guidance to name their configs, plugins, and rules consistently to each other and the linter core.
Users then would have an easier time navigating the plugin ecosystem and understanding how they all fit together.

## Granular Rule Categories

Over the last decade, the linter community learned the hard way that users need properly categorized shared configs.
If you give everyone one config that mixes _logical_ and _stylistic_ rules the way, say, `eslint-plugin-airbnb` did, users will resent the portions they disagree with and turn away from linting altogether.
Plugins that include both of those broad areas of rules now tend to provide dedicated shared configs for different areas of rules [^jsdoc-granular-flat-typescript-configs] [^typescript-eslint-configs].

Once a consistent glossary exists, its definitions can be used to consistently categorize configs and rules.
Heck, the linter could even provide recommended utilities for generating configs based on rule categories.
I think that'd go a long way towards further standardizing and making clear the ecosystem of plugin rules.
At the very least, it'd help encourage plugin authors to make it easier for users to include only the categories of rules they want from the plugin.
