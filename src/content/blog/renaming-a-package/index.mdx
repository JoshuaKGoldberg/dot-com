Natural languages are imprecise and vague.
Programming concepts and tools we describe using natural language are precise and purposeful.
It's a recipe for disaster.

I've twice now had to name a surprisingly difficult-to-name package.
This post is the saga of the two processes I went through.

## Take One

Back in 2019, I'd created a package that converts JavaScript code to TypeScript code.
By nature that means it can also improve types in existing TypeScript code.
I'd settled on the following marketing bits:

- Description: _"Converts JavaScript to TypeScript and TypeScript to better TypeScript."_
- Name: _**TypeStat**_

I liked the name TypeStat.
A lot of other TypeScript packages at the time had names starting with _"Type"_, such as TypeDoc and ???.
In medicine, "stat" means "as soon as possible": thematically appropriate for the library's goal of getting you TypeScript types quickly
TypeStat seemed like a great idea at the time.

I even created a cute logo for TypeStat, putting a ➕ in place of the "TS" in the TypeScript logo:

### The Problem With TypeStat

Nobody knows what the name "TypeStat" means!
Every time I introduced it at an event, people would struggle to remember the name.
I've gotten a steady tricle of feedback from other developers over the years that it was a confusing name.

TypeStat needed to go.

## Good Timing

Towards the end of this past summer (2023), I was focusing on cleaning up [create-typescript-app](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app) to be used in the rest of my repositories.
create-typescript-app was picking up adoption online and growing in GitHub stars & contributions organically.
I wanted to give it a nice logo... and TypeStat's '➕' logo would be _fantastic_.

It was the perfect storm.
All I had to do now was find a new name for TypeStat.
How difficult could that be?

## Take Two

This time around, I wanted to switch the name to one starting with _"ts-"_.
That format is a more recent trend in TypeScript packages (ts-api-utils, ts-loader, ...) and I like it for consistency.

Right from the start I knew a great _"ts-"_ name for TypeStat: _"ts-up"_.
It conveys that you're TypeScript-ing "up" your code, and also lifting your types quality up.
But, the tsup package had already laid claim to that name.
Alas.

### Boundless Possibilities

I next tried to think of similar names, like _ts-convert_.
But I realized quickly that the package name would need to convey both parts of TypeStat's purpose:

- _Addition_: adding in TypeScript types to JavaScript or TypeScript files missing them
- _Improvement_: improving existing types in TypeScript files

ts-add?
ts-better?
ts-on?
It seemed like every potential name I thought of was either too vague or only covered one of the two purposes.
;

### False Hope

One name that did stick out to me was _ts-aid_.
I liked ts-aid for similar reasons to TypeStat:

- It

## Getting Serious

At this point I was feeling frustrated.
I'd wanted a new name fast, but was getting lost in all the options.
It was time to get organized about coming to a decision.

### Crowdsourcing

### Getting Organized

When I'm having a hard time choosing betwen many competing options, one of my go-to strategies is making a comparison table.
I'll identify the important aspects to judge each option on, identify all the potentially viable options, and fill out the table.

## Why Care?

Why put so much thought, energy, and work into finding the right package name?
Because names are important.

Names are how users discover your package, then remember it later on.
If someone is Googling or searching in npm for a a phrase like _"convert to typescript"_, they're much more likely to try out a name that seems to match what they're looking for.

Also, finding the right name for a thing is fun.
I get a similar kick from it as from figuring out a clean architecture for a coding problem.
