Happy belated new year, everyone!
I posted my [2024 In Review](/blog/2024-in-review) blog a week ago.
Now it's time to look forward to the remaining ~10-11 months of this year.

As with last year's [My Plans for 2024](/blog/my-plans-for-2024), this post is 40% a reference for anybody curious about my work... and 60% a form of self-motivation.

## General Goals

My 2025 goal is to make it as easy as possible for to have great web development tooling.
The primary ways I will do that are:

1. Continue to maintain or otherwise contribute to impactful projects such as [ESLint](#eslint), [Mocha](#mocha), [typescript-eslint](#typescript-eslint), and [Yeoman](#yeoman)
2. Build the best repository templating engine possible: [create](#createbingo)
3. Onboard [create-typescript-app](#create-typescript-app) to that engine
4. Consolidate common issue and pull request linting tasks into a GitHub-focused linter: [Glint](#glint)
5. Increase the power and simplicity of developer tooling provided by [create-typescript-app](#create-typescript-app)
6. Stabilize tooling that converts from JavaScript to TypeScript and TypeScript to better TypeScript: [ts-lift](#ts-lift)
7. Socialize great developer tooling with [Boston TS Club](#boston-ts-club) and [SquiggleConf](#squiggleconf)

## Open Source

[I'm a full time independent open source maintainer](../full-time-open-source).
I'm going to continue to spend the majority of my time maintaining open source libraries I'm responsible for, as well as contributing to other libraries.

### Finances

> See my 2024 income breakdown in [2024 Finances in Review](/blog/2024-finances-in-review).

I took in a total income of roughly $60,191 for 2024.
$47,269 of that was for open source work.

My high-level financial goal for 2025 is to grow my total income by ~25% to **$75,000**.
I'd like that to come from approximately 75% open source income, 25% other income:

- Open source: growing ~20% from ~$47.3k to ~$57k
- Other work: growing ~25% from ~$13.6k to ~$17k

~$67k a year for open source is ~$4,750 a month.
I think I can hit that through:

- typescript-eslint: $1,500 a month, or roughly 20% more than the current $1,250 a month
- ESLint: $1,000 a month, or 20 hours of $50/hour invoiced time
- Mocha: $600 a month, or 14 hours of $50/hour invoiced time
- Yeoman: $400 a month, as new income via Tidelift and thanks.dev
- GitHub Sponsors: $600 a month, slightly more than the current ~$500 a month
- Tidelift: $500 a month, doubling the current ~$250 a month
- thanks.dev: $150 a month, doubling the current ~$75 a month

~$17k a year for other work is ~$1,400 a month.
I think I can hit that through:

- _Learning TypeScript_ book sales: $500 a month, or $6,000 for the year
- Podcasting: $600 a month, or $7,200 for the year
- Miscellaneous consulting or workshops: about $3,800 for the year
  - This will be my backup if any other source falls short

This is not ideal.
I'd prefer to not consult at all.
But the open source sponsorships are not likely to increase enough to take over that number.
Consulting and workshops it is.

### Larger Projects

These ecosystem-level projects are high visibility to many web developers.
My work in pushing them forward helps make their areas of development incrementally better for many developers.
It's fun and humbling to think about.

#### [typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io)

I'm on the typescript-eslint maintainer team.
Unlike 2024, I don't plan on pushing for any major user-facing changes.
I'd like 2025 to be a more calm year for my typescript-eslint involvement.

##### Documentation

> Objective: Rework the website to better explain the project.
>
> Objective: Publish &ge;4 long-requested blog posts.

The landing page on [typescript-eslint.io](https://typescript-eslint.io) hasn't been reworked in a long time.
It prioritizes explaining what ESLint and TypeScript are over the benefits or definition of typescript-eslint.

[@ElianCodes](https://github.com/ElianCodes) led me through an [audit of typescript-eslint.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vyu8FU0VAqA) last year.
I'd like to apply the suggestions from that audit to the typescript-eslint website.

Additionally, many longstanding community gripes about typescript-eslint and typed linting come in part from us not explaining ourselves well.
I want us to have published at least 4 more blog posts that answer frequent user questions.
At the very least, that should include:

- [typescript-eslint#7350 Docs: Add blog post & revamped docs for parserOptions.projectService](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/7350)
- [typescript-eslint#8517 Blog: Add post about our suite of Promise rules](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/8517)

##### Issue Management

> Objective: Finish the year with &lt;250 issues
>
> Objective: Close out &ge;3 of 4 issues from 2019
>
> Objective: Close out &ge;20 of 26 issues from 2019-2020

We started 2024 with about 400 open issues in our backlog and ended with just under 300 open issues.
I don't like having many hundreds of issues in a backlog.

Some old issues might be reasonable to accept pull requests but not important enough for us to prioritize.
But too many old issues crowd out important ones.
The more issues exist in an issue tracker, the less likely any one issue will be addressed.

I'd like to generally continue shrinking the backlog down by ending 2025 with just under 250 open issues, or 50 fewer than what we have now.

More specifically, we still have 26 issues from many years ago: 22 from 2020 and 4 from 2019.
I'd also like to get through at least 75% of those.

#### ESLint

> Objective: Consistently work as an ESLint team member.

I'm on the ESLint committer team.
I still don't have any big flashy goals around ESLint.
For my second year I just want to be a good, reliable member of the team.

If I consistently apply >15 hours a month to ESLint, and the work is an acceptable quality, I'll be happy.

#### Mocha

> Objective: Provide first-party TypeScript types with Mocha
>
> Objective: Release Mocha 12 with long-pending small breaking changes
>
> Objective: Release the new Mocha website

I'm on the new Mocha maintainer team ([mocha#5027 📌 Project Status: Maintenance Reboot](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/5027)).
2024 was mostly a _"pick up the pieces"_ year for Mocha.

Now that I'm more confident as a maintainer for Mocha, I'm ready to make more impactful changes.
The biggest is [mocha/milestone/66 v12.0.0](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/milestone/66): releasing a new major version with actual breaking changes.
Fixing old annoyances and removing long-deprecated features will be good for the project but technically requires a new major version.

Separately, [mocha#4154 🚀 Feature: TypeScript .d.ts type declarations](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/4154) is the single most requested issue people bring up with me when they hear I took on Mocha maintenance.

Lastly, I made a new version of the ancient Mocha website using Astro last year: [mocha#5246 docs: add new website using Astro Starlight](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/pull/5246).
I'd like to get that website fully launched this year, with the old website kept on something like `old.mochajs.org`.

#### Yeoman

> Objective: End 2025 having triaged and reviewed all Yeoman issues and pull requests older than a week
>
> Objective: Clean up all known out-of-date information on [yeoman.io](https://https://yeoman.io)
>
> Objective: Update `yo` and other packages to no longer print deprecation warnings when run

I joined the [Yeoman maintenance reboot](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/1779) in January! 🎩

Our goal is to keep Yeoman afloat.
We don't plan on releasing any major breaking changes or earth-shattering new features.
We mostly want to keep the project up with the basic expectations developers have around running tools.

#### [`create`](https://create.bingo)

> Objective: Create in-memory, Handlebars-based, and Blocks-based templating systems
>
> Objective: Create an automated repository migration flow based on GitHub Actions
>
> Objective: Release a well-documented `create@1`

The [`create`](https://create.bingo) project is my take on a templating engine.
Its feature set represents points that I think no existing engine comes close to capturing a majority of:

- Ability to swap pieces of tooling in and out
- Migrations to newer template versions
- Test-friendly APIs for in-memory template creations
- Well-typed options through a standard schema ([Zod](https://zod.dev))

I find all that very exciting: especially the "Blocks" system I'd originally envisioned for it ([create-typescript-app#1181 📝 Documentation: Long-term project vision](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app/issues/1181)).
Also automated migrations, so I don't have to keep manually updating old repositories to new tooling config files.

#### [create-typescript-app](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app)

> Objective: Release a stable create-typescript-app@v2 built on `create`
>
> Objective: Reduce root files from 19 to 16
>
> Objective: Support monorepos
>
> Objective: Close out 14 of the 19 open issues I'd filed through 2022 and 2023.

As of writing, create-typescript-app is _almost_ ready to promote a v2 version rebuilt on `create` from beta to stable.
It's only blocked on a few foundational rearchitectures in `create`.

Firstly, I aim to continue reducing the number of root-level files produced by the template.
Tooling fatigue is a real problem for web developers.
Every file added to repositories contributes to that fatigue.
I'm pretty sure I can get rid of three config files from CTA:

- `.markdownlint.json` and `.markdownlintignore`: [create-typescript-app#1926 🚀 Feature: Use `@eslint/markdown` instead of markdownlint](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app/issues/1926)
- `.all-contributorsrc`: [create-typescript-app#1930 🚀 Feature: Use all-contributors (or an equivalent) without creating a root-level file (.all-contributorsrc)](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app/issues/1930)

I'm also targeting two goals for 2025 that are carried over from [My Plans for 2024 > create-typescript-app](/blog/my-plans-for-2024#create-typescript-app).

The biggest one is monorepo support.
I personally want CTA monorepo support for my own monorepos such as [emoji-blast](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/emoji-blast) and [TypeStat (`ts-lift`)](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/TypeStat).

The CTA issue tracker still has 19 issues from 2022 or 2023, 9 of which are features.
4 of those issues are `status: blocked`, leaving 15 issues that I should be able to close out.
Adding a safe buffer of 1 issue leaves me with a goal of resolving 14 issues, or ~75% of the 19.

#### Glint

> Objective: Make a stable lint experience for GitHub repositories -- including issues and pull requests
>
> Onboard Glint to be used in `create-typescript-app`

This section is copied over from [My Plans for 2024 > Standalone GitHub Linter](/blog/my-plans-for-2024#standalone-github-linter).

One of the biggest pain points I've had in managing GitHub repositories is standardizing practices around comments, issues, and pull requests:

- Comments: not being obvious spam, including alt text for accessible images, ...
- Issues: additionally: filling out required information, ensuring the title isn't the default, ...
- Pull requests: additionally: ensuring the PR addresses an open accepted issue, asking users not to force push, ...

`create-typescript-app` uses a few dedicated GitHub Actions to enforce some of those needs for now.
But that's inconvenient.
I'd like to make a generalized linter for all those needs.
It will be configurable with granular rules, plugins, and shared configs like a typical linter.

I haven't started deep design work on Glint.
But I'm confident I can make it a _shining_ example of repository tooling.

#### [TypeStat](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/TypeStat) (`ts-lift`)

> Objective: Rebrand, re-document, and stabilize TypeStat as a `ts-lift` monorepo.
>
> Objective: Create a `ts-initialize` project within `ts-lift` that reliably converts projects from JavaScript to TypeScript.
>
> Objective: Create a `ts-enhance` project within `ts-lift` that reliably improves TypeScript types when possible.

This section is partially copied over from [My Plans for 2024 > TypeStat (`ts-lift`)](/blog/my-plans-for-2024#typestat-ts-lift).

Two factors make me more confident in tackling TypeStat this year:

- `create-typescript-app` being much more fleshed out and stable, with monorepo support planned for ~~2024~~ 2025.
- Resolving TypeStat's ["Find a new name for this library" issue](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/TypeStat/issues/1040): Knowing that I'm going to split it into:
  - `ts-lift` for the general package name
  - `ts-initialize` for the onboarding portion ("JavaScript to TypeScript")
  - `ts-enhance` for the types improving portion ("TypeScript to better TypeScript")

That better understanding of how to split up the project means I can really think through the architecture and documentation.
Splitting `ts-initialize` and `ts-enhance` out of the shared core means I can focus them on doing their respective tasks.

...and, as much as I hate to cave to tech trend hype, it's possible that `ts-enhance` could use AI to solve type generation challenges that would otherwise be prohibitively difficult.
We'll see.

### Smaller Projects

I'd previously called this _"Personal Projects"_ to convey that I want to work on more "fun" projects.
But that's not the right name.
Since going full time open source I've mostly stopped working on coding projects in my personal time.
These smaller projects might be more fun, but still contribute to the greater web ecosystem.

	src={jakeBabyButtDancing}
/>

#### [eslint-plugin-expect-type](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/eslint-plugin-expect-type)

> Objective: Get adopted by DefinitelyTyped.

This section is partially copied over from [My Plans for 2024 > eslint-plugin-expect-type](/blog/my-plans-for-2024#eslint-plugin-expect-type).

`eslint-plugin-expect-type` is a handy ESLint plugin that allows enforcing `^?` twoslash assertion comments and the like.
In 2024 I'd expanded the plugin to encompass all the features I know [DefinitelyTyped-tools](https://github.com/Microsoft/DefinitelyTyped-tools) uses in its `@definitelytyped/expect` equivalent.
I think it'd be great to reduce lint rule duplication and onboard DefinitelyTyped to the same rule as other consumers in the ecosystem.

#### [eslint-plugin-package-json](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/eslint-plugin-package-json)

> Objective: Finish achieving feature parity with other package.json linters

I adopted the ESLint plugin for `package.json` files in 2023 because I wanted to flesh out its feature set.
Some rules exist in other package.json linters that are not yet available in `eslint-plugin-package-json`.
You can see the full list of linter rules in [eslint-plugin-package-json#42 📌 Tracking issue: comparison with equivalent other tools](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/eslint-plugin-package-json/issues/42).

For 2025, I'd like to finish filling out that list of rules.
This will involve creating granular APIs in [`package-json-validator`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/package-json-validator), another project I adopted.

#### Mint

> Objective: Publish a blog post fully describing my idealized general web linter
>
> Objective: Prototype a general web linter with first-class support for cross-file linting

I'm not going to compete with ESLint in 2025.
typescript-eslint is not going anywhere anytime soon.
I'm burying this project goal deep in this blog post because I don't want anybody to misread and think this is some big ecosystem competitor or drama.

ESLint is structurally focused on _single-file_ linting: each lint rule is architecturally encouraged to only think of one rule at a time.
Single-file linting falls apart when you add [typed linting](https://typescript-eslint.io/blog/typed-linting).
See [eslint/rfcs#102 feat: parsing session objects](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/pull/102).

I think any modern web linter needs to have first-class support for _cross-file_ linting.
[ESLint's rewrite](http://github.com/eslint/rewrite) is positioned as the place for ESLint to work on that.
Native speed linters are starting to integrate typed linting, too: e.g. [Biome's `noFloatingPromises` rule](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/4911).

I want to help work on cross-file linting -- but have found it difficult to propose ideas given my lack of experience of actually writing a linter.
And even for the ideas I'm confident in, not having a proof-of-concept linter to show my ideas working is a further detriment.

So, I plan on finally writing my own _fresh_, modern linter in 2025.
😱.

To do this, I'm first going to publish a blog post explaining all my ideas for what a modern web linter could do.
See [JoshuaKGoldberg/dot-com#296 🚀 Feature: Blog post on "If I Wrote a Linter"](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/dot-com/issues/296).
That issue is blocked by a chain of other blog posts explaining nuances such as [JoshuaKGoldberg/dot-com#297 🚀 Feature: Blog post on why I'd write a linter in TypeScript](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/dot-com/issues/297).

#### Other Packages

> Objective: Maintain a small suite of well-managed open source repositories in my areas of interest.

This section is copied over from [My Plans for 2024 > Other Packages)](/blog/my-plans-for-2024#other-packages).

I don't exclusively work on my larger visibility projects: I also have a collection of smaller utilities addressing needs I've wanted to create over the years.
They've all been onboarded to `create-typescript-app`.
I plan on further onboarding those packages to `create`'s automated tooling updates.

I'm also a committer or maintainer on a few other packages that I didn't make and generally enjoy helping out with, such as [`dedent`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/dedent) and [`node-emoji`](https://github.com/omnidan/node-emoji).
I don't plan on leading any major changes for them: just keeping them well-maintained.

## Community Engagement

It's invaluable both for open source maintainers and book authors to be engaged with the community.
We get valuable user feedback and project exposure by being a known name.

	src={finnJakeDancingLSP}
/>

### Conferences

> Objective: Give all conference talks I'm happy with.

As noted in [2024 in Review > Conferences](https://www.joshuakgoldberg.com/blog/2024-in-review/#conferences), I'm holding steady at giving a conference talk every 1-2 months.
My goal is to be happy with the content and quality talks I'm giving.

As of writing this post I'm scheduled for 4 in-person conferences through June.
I don't plan on adding more than 1-2 additional in-person conference talks.

### Blogging

> Objective: Publish at least one blog post every three weeks
>
> Objective: Publish at least one post in each blog every three months

I have a few blogs under my purview:

- My main personal blog at [joshuakgoldberg.com/blog](https://joshuakgoldberg.com/blog)
- _Learning TypeScript_'s blog at [learningtypescript.com/articles](https://learningtypescript.com/articles)
- typescript-eslint's blog at [typescript-eslint.io/blog](https://typescript-eslint.io/blog)

I missed my blog post goals in both [2023 In Review > Goal: Branding and Blogging](/blog/2023-in-review/#goal-branding-and-blogging) and [2024 In Review > Blogging](/blog/2024-in-review/#blogging).
For this year I'm reducing the target numbers by about a third.

### [Boston TS Club](https://bostonts.club)

> Objective: Produce ten successful monthly meetups for Boston TS Club
>
> Objective: Create and keep schedules for those meetups
>
> Objective: Step down as "director" and eliminate the singular leadership role

Boston TS Club is Boston's monthly meetup for TypeScript and other web development areas.
I'm very happy with how it's going: see [2024 in Review > Boston TS Club](/blog/2024-in-review#boston-ts-club).

For the meetups, my main hope for 2025 is to keep doing more of the same, but more organized.
We'd like to turn our gained knowledge into more predictable meetups: e.g. publishing the timing of talks and networking sessions ahead of time.

Running a meetup is an investment of both time and emotional energy.
I also hope to move away a sole "director" role the way I run it now.
Instead, we're looking to:

- Give each organizer autonomy and ownership over their area, with "understudies" who also learn the area
- Have the "director" role cycle between organizers every few months, to share experience gains and responsibility

My goal for 2025 is to make Boston TS Club able run smoothly even if any organizer -including and especially myself- leaves.

### [SquiggleConf](https://2025.squiggleconf.com)

> Objective: Successfully run SquiggleConf 2025 without any major problems
>
> Objective: Get 150 peak attendance
>
> Objective: Break even 💸
>
> Objective: Don't burn out

SquiggleConf is Boston's yearly conference for web development tooling.
I'm very happy with how it's going: see [2024 in Review > SquiggleConf](/blog/2024-in-review#squiggleconf).

My primary conference goal here is for nothing terrible to happen.
Running a large event is _scary_.
There are a lot of moving parts to contend with.

2024 saw about 125 attendees throughout the day.
Now that we have more brand recognition and local ties, I'd like to grow to 150 people for a nice full-feeling event.

2024 came out to a deficit of several thousand dollars.
I think we can at least break even in 2025, hopefully positioning ourselves to least make back our 2024 money within 2026.

Lastly, and perhaps most important for me personally, I don't want to burn out again in 2025.
2024's post-SquiggleConf burnout wrecked my productivity and impacted my personal health through October and much of November.
I'm optimistic that with the awesome team, as well as starting conference work several months earlier in the year, I'll avoid spending a month overeating ramen and re-watching _Mad Men_.

## Personal

Personal happiness and health are key to sustainable development.
These goals are largely copy & pasted from [My Plans for 2024 > Personal](/blog/my-plans-for-2024/#personal).

### Goal: Health

> Objective: Eat healthy, balanced meals most days of the week
>
> Objective: Reliably work out about three times a week

This section is partially copied over from [My Plans for 2024 > Goal: Health](/blog/my-plans-for-2024#goal-health).

I did well for stabilizing myself through the first two-thirds of 2024 or so.
Then SquiggleConf work picked up in earnest.
Once that was done the US election picked up too.
Neither was good for my personal health.

I still aim for the roughly the same goals as last year:

- Wake up before 7am on weekdays and 8am on weekends at least 6 days a week
- Average 8 hours of work a day & 40 hour weeks
  - I can go over for time-sensitive work, but need to compensate in a subsequent time period
- Eat three balanced, healthy meals a day at least 6 days a week
- Work out at least three times a week
- Date night with my spouse at least once a week

My stress gets worse when I'm stressed by work and/or the awful nation-wide events happening around me.
The former I can control.
The latter I cannot control, and am trying to separate out from work as much as possible for my mental health.

### Goal: Personal Accountability

> Objective: Have confidence in the amount of work I've accomplished.
>
> Objective: Feel good about the amount of work I've accomplished.

I have a tendency to be self-critical and drive myself to the point of burnout.
I also tend to undervalue the magnitude of work I accomplish in any time period.

I used to keep a tracking Notion database & board for tasks.
I also promised myself I'd use that to feel good about the amount of work I did.
Those were surface "band-aid" fixes for deeper insecurities, so I'm not surprised that they didn't stick.

This year, I'm going to try to center myself and address the root cause.
I have a new therapist who is helping me connect with my emotions.
If I get done most of what I say I want to in this post, I want to also feel good about about that.

We'll see.

## Out of Scope

I'm not going to tackle any of the points from [My Plans for 2024 > Out of Scope](/blog/my-plans-for-2024#out-of-scope):

- Conferences galore: I enjoy conferences, but doing too many of them is exhausting and takes time away from my other work
- Twitch streaming: similarly exhausting and it's hard to tackle higher-scoped work than small bugfixes and features during it
- Older personal projects: work-life balance is important and I want to stay away from coding in my personal time

I just can't justify the time expenditure for them.

### Stretch Goals

Procrastination is one of my toxic traits.
I'm very good at motivating myself to do something because I'm more interested in it at the moment than what I'm supposed to be doing.
Keeping a consistent supply of _"wouldn't this be nice?"_ projects is a surefire way to keep myself productive.

The biggest top-of-mind projects for me are simplifications to the create-typescript-app template:

- Moving CSpell into ESLint: thereby removing the `cspell.json` file
- Removing `.nvmrc` in favor of `package.json` `"engines"`
- Replacing `husky` + `lint-staged` with a simpler system
- Replacing tsup with a zero-config builder

No guarantees these will happen anytime soon.
But it's nice to dream.

## Closing Thoughts

I've got a lot of objectives for 2025.
I _think_ the big splashy ones are doable as long as I focus on one each month or two and hold overflow time at the end of the year:

1. February and March: [`create`](#create) and [`create-typescript-app`](#create-typescript-app)
2. April: [Glint](#glint)
3. May: [Mint](#mint)
4. June: [TypeStat (`ts-lift`)](#typestat-ts-lift)
5. July: [Mocha](#mocha), [Yeoman](#yeoman), and [other packages](#other-packages)
6. August and September: [SquiggleConf](#squiggleconf)
7. October-November: overflow

Even if I don't make all of those goals, it's going to be an exciting year!
