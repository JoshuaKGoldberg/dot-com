## Preamble

This is the companion blog post for my [TSConf 2020](https://tsconf.io) talk.
At the end of it, we'll have figured out how to take a template string literal like this one, simulate a Tic Tac Toe game on it, figure out who the winner of that game is.

```ts
type Winner = TicTacToe<`
    X 1 1
    O 2 2
    X 2 0
    O 0 2
    X 1 0
    O 0 0
    X 1 2
`>;
```

> Just looking for the end result?
> Skip down to **[the final product](#the-final-product)**.

While our surface _agenda_ might be to implement silly type system games, our _purpose_ is to gain a better understanding of how the TypeScript type system works, how to use it to improve our development practices, and what to do with all this newfound information.

The attached slides also include an introduction to type systems and a real-world example for each concept introduced before expanding the type system game engine using that concept.
I've left those out of this blog post to keep it trim.

## Conditional Generics

<small>
	ðŸ‘‰{" "}
	<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#conditional-types">
		TypeScript docs: Conditional Types
	</a>
</small>

Our first type system exploration will be 'conditional generics', which are a technique for generating types based on the properties of other types.
Conditional types _take in other types_ and spit out new types based on the original one.

Take a look at this type:

```ts
type RockMatchup<Opponent> = Opponent extends "Rock"
	? "Draw"
	: Opponent extends "Paper"
	? "Loss"
	: "Win";
```

That's a description of how a player's Rock choice in a game of Tic Tac Toe works against its possible opponents.

If the opponent is a `'Rock'`:

```ts
type Result = RockMatchup<"Rock">;
// 'Draw'
```

...then the result is a `'Draw'`.
If the opponent is `'Paper'`, the player's Rock loses; if the opponent is anything else (so, `'Scissors'`), the player's Rock wins.

Fun fact: types may receive more than one generic.
In this next snippet, we define the matchups for two players, with a bunch of nested checks for each of the nine possible results.

```ts
type RockPaperScissors<Player, Opponent> =
	// Player is Rock
	Player extends "Rock"
		? Opponent extends "Rock"
			? "Draw"
			: Opponent extends "Paper"
			? "Loss"
			: "Win"
		: // Player is Paper
		Player extends "Paper"
		? Opponent extends "Rock"
			? "Win"
			: Opponent extends "Paper"
			? "Draw"
			: "Loss"
		: // Player is Scissors
		Opponent extends "Rock"
		? "Loss"
		: Opponent extends "Paper"
		? "Win"
		: "Draw";
```

Amusing.

## Type Members

<small>
	ðŸ‘‰{" "}
	<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#index-types">
		TypeScript docs: Index Types
	</a>
</small>

Now that we've established how to add _logic_ to the type system, let's expand another dimension of type system logic by looking at nested types within types.

The `keyof` operator in the type system takes in a type we need the keys of and spits back a union of just those keys.
When a type is known to be a key of another type, you can use it to retrieve the corresponding member under that key.

We can use `keyof` to declare our Tic Tac Toe matchups as a big type system object and index into it to find the matchups for our player and opponent:

```ts
type Matchups = {
	Rock: {
		Paper: "Loss";
		Scissors: "Win";
	};
	Paper: {
		Rock: "Win";
		Scissors: "Loss";
	};
	Scissors: {
		Rocker: "Loss";
		Paper: "Win";
	};
};

type RockPaperScissors<
	Player extends keyof Matchups,
	Opponent extends keyof Matchups
> = Opponent extends keyof Matchups[Player]
	? Matchups[Player][Opponent]
	: "Draw";
```

That new and enhanced `RockPaperScissors` type takes in a `Player` and an `Opponent`, both of which must be one of the keys of `Matchups`: i.e. `'Rock'`, `'Paper'`, or `'Scissors'`.

- If the `Opponent` type is one of the members of the `Matchup`'s listing under the Player, we go with that value.
- Otherwise, we assume it's a `'Draw'`.

```ts
type Result = RockPaperScissors<"Paper", "Scissors">; // 'Loss'
```

The `extends` keyword in `RockPaperScissors` is important: it tells the type system that the generic type parameter must be that particular type, or a more specific version of it.

## Tuple Types

<small>
	ðŸ‘‰{" "}
	<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#tuple">
		TypeScript docs: Tuple Types
	</a>
</small>

We've explored logical types and members thereof.
Now let's dig into arrays of types, also known as tuples.
We'll be able to use these to declare full-on game boards: not just single-use logical comparisons.

First, let's declare a couple of types:

```ts
type Cell = " " | "X" | "O";

type TicTacToeBoard = [
	[Cell, Cell, Cell],
	[Cell, Cell, Cell],
	[Cell, Cell, Cell]
];
```

- `Cell` is the content of any slot on our game board: either the empty string (not yet placed), an `'X'`, or an '`O'`.
- `TicTacToeBoard` is a tuple of tuples, representing a grid of spots on a 3x3 board.

In other words, we now have a 3x3 board of cells! ðŸš€

### Victory Conditions

Using `Cell` and `TicTacToeBoard` as bases, we can create a conditional `Victory` type in the type system that takes in a board and returns a new type representing whether that board any of the three possible victory conditions for that board: three-in-a-row diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.

```ts
type Victory<Player, Board> = Board extends WinningBoard<Player> ? true : false;

type WinningBoard<Player> =
	| DiagonalVictory<Player>
	| HorizontalVictory<Player>
	| VerticalVictory<Player>;
```

The diagonal win condition for a player is hit when either of the diagonal lines on the board can only be that player's pieces.
The Cell spots can be filled with anything, but the Player spots must be filled with only the player's pieces.

```ts
type DiagonalVictory<Player> =
	| [[Player, any, any], [any, Player, any], [any, any, Player]]
	| [[any, any, Player], [any, Player, any], [Player, any, any]];
```

Similarly, the horizontal victory check is satisfied only when one of the three rows in the board are known to contain only the player's pieces.

```ts
type HorizontalVictory<Player> =
	| [[Player, Player, Player], [any, any, any], [any, any, any]]
	| [[any, any, any], [Player, Player, Player], [any, any, any]]
	| [[any, any, any], [any, any, any], [Player, Player, Player]];
```

Same with the vertical victory check and the board's columns.

```ts
type VerticalVictory<Player> =
	| [[Player, any, any], [Player, any, any], [Player, any, any]]
	| [[any, Player, any], [any, Player, any], [any, Player, any]]
	| [[any, any, Player], [any, any, Player], [any, any, Player]];
```

Making use of the WinningBoard type, we can see that a WinAtStart check for a board comprised entirely of blanks is false.
None of the 8 win conditions are satisfied by that board.

```ts
type StartingBoard = [[" ", " ", " "], [" ", " ", " "], [" ", " ", " "]];

type WinAtStart = Victory<"X", StartingBoard>;
// false
```

If we add a few pieces and include a diagonal victory for the checked piece, however, our result becomes true.
Success!

```ts
type HowAboutNow = Victory<
	"O",
	[["O", " ", "X"], ["X", "O", " "], [" ", "X", "O"]]
>;
// true
```

Taking our conditionals one step higher, we can check which player â€“if eitherâ€“ wins by seeing whether the board satisfies the victory condition for either of our known players.

```ts
type Winner<Board> = Victory<"X", Board> extends true
	? "X"
	: Victory<"O", Board> extends true
	? "O"
	: " ";

type StartingWinner = Winner<StartingBoard>;
// ' '

type WinnerNow = Winner<[["O", " ", "X"], ["X", "O", " "], [" ", "X", "O"]]>;
// 'O'
```

Nifty.

## Mapped Types

<small>
	ðŸ‘‰{" "}
	<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#mapped-types">
		TypeScript docs: Mapped Types
	</a>
</small>

In this section, we'll introduce ways to transform all members of types in our type decision making, which will open the doors to much more grandiose dynamic type system type generation.

Mapped types take in a list of keys, such as from a keyof operator, and create new type members based on them.

For example, we can use mapped types to declare a Tic Tac Toe board in a bit more dynamic of a manner:

```ts
type TicTacToeBoard = {
	[Row in 0 | 1 | 2]: {
		[Column in 0 | 1 | 2]: Cell;
	};
};
```

Under this description, any object that has arrays under 0, 1, and 2 which themselves contain Cells under 0, 1, and 2 match the board.
That'll come in handy later when we set up mapped types so weird that TypeScript forgets the result was supposed to be an array.

In fact, this particular type is no longer describing an array, so checking for victory types above will need to switch to object descriptions (since declaring tuple types indicates the type _must_ be an array):

```ts
// Like this, but for all the board descriptions...
{
    0: { 0: Player, 1: any, 2: any },
    1: { 0: any, 1: Player, 2: any },
    2: { 0: any, 1: any, 2: Player },
}
```

### Board Transitions

Now that we know how to map all members of a type into a new type, we should be able to apply that technique to placing pieces on a Tic Tac Toe board.
Given our starting board from before and a desire to place 'X' at row 0 / column 1, we should be able to use conditional mapped types to take in our board tuples and output a modified board.

```ts
type FirstMove = ["X", 0, 1];

type AfterFirstMove = [[" ", "X", " "], [" ", " ", " "], [" ", " ", " "]];
```

This is how we can accomplish such a move in the type system:

```ts
type ReplaceInBoard<
	Board extends TicTacToeBoard,
	Replacement extends Cell,
	RowPlace extends 0 | 1 | 2,
	ColumnPlace extends 0 | 1 | 2
> = {
	[Row in 0 | 1 | 2]: {
		[Column in 0 | 1 | 2]: [Row, Column] extends [RowPlace, ColumnPlace]
			? Replacement
			: Board[Row][Column];
	};
};
```

`ReplaceInBoard` takes in four type inputs:

- `Board`: original board to work on
- `Replacement`: new piece on the board
- `RowPlace`: row index to place at
- `ColumnPlace`: column index to place at

It output a new object type where, for each member under rows 0-2 and columns 0-2, checking whether that's the same row and column to replace at:

- If yes: use the new piece
- If no: use the original board's piece

I'll also note here that although our ReplaceInBoard type works, it's pushing the boundaries of what the type system is really intended for, so it loses just a little bit of clarity.
TypeScript sees the resultant type as an object with number keys.

```ts
type AfterFirstMoveMap = ReplaceInBoard<StartingBoard, "X", 0, 1>;
// {
//     0: { 0: " "; 1: "X"; 2: " "; };
//     1: { 0: " "; 1: " "; 2: " "; };
//     2: { 0: " "; 1: " "; 2: " "; };
// }
```

Still, the result is what we want: a new board based on the original with the move applied!

## Inferred Types

<small>
	ðŸ‘‰{" "}
	<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#type-inference-in-conditional-types">
		TypeScript docs: Type Inference in Conditional Types
	</a>
</small>

What I'd like to do now is take a starting board and an array of moves, then generate how the board should look after all of them have been applied.
This'll let us simulate a full-on game of Tic Tac Toe based on the move inputs.

This is difficult because there's no 'for loop' operator in the type system.
We can't set up a type and imperatively modify it the way we would in, say, JavaScript.

```ts
type AllMoves = [["X", 0, 1], ["O", 2, 2]];

type AfterAllMoves = [[" ", "X", " "], [" ", " ", " "], [" ", " ", "O"]];
```

TypeScript's type system is closer to a _functional_ language (or even a _logical_) one, which is to say nothing can be modified after creation, and all inferences must be made based on already defined truths.

### Thinking Functionally

If we were working in runtime code, we'd tackle this functional problem recursively.

```ts
type Move = [Cell, 0 | 1 | 2, 0 | 1 | 2];

// There are two possibilities when calling our applyMoves function:
function applyMoves(board: TicTacToeBoard, moves: Move[]) {
	// 1. If the remaining moves are empty, we can return the board as-is
	if (moves.length === 0) {
		return board;
	}

	// 2. If there's at least one move to apply, we apply it,
	//    then recurse on the new board with the remaining moves
	const nextBoard = replaceInBoard(board, moves[0]);
	const remainingMoves = moves.slice(1);

	return applyMoves(nextBoard, remainingMoves);
}
```

### Typing Functionally

Our code in the type system looks a little different but amounts to the same result.

```ts
type Move = [Cell, 0 | 1 | 2, 0 | 1 | 2];

type ApplyMoves<
	Board extends TicTacToeBoard,
	Moves extends Move[]
> = Moves extends []
	? Board
	: ApplyMoves<
			ReplaceInBoard<Board, Moves[0][0], Moves[0][1], Moves[0][2]>,
			DropFirst<Moves>
	  >;
```

- First, if the moves extends the empty array (so, if there are no more moves), the resultant type is the board itself.
- Otherwise, we return a resultant type from `ApplyMoves`. That recursive type system call to `ApplyMoves` takes in the result of applying our first move to the board for a board, and all but the first move from our moves as its array of moves.

The remaining moves are calculated using a `DropFirst` type that shows off why we just learned about inferred types.

```ts
type DropFirst<T extends unknown[]> = T extends [any, ...infer U] ? U : [];
```

DropFirst takes in a `T` that must be an array, then checks if it's possible for a remaining array (using the `...`, or spread, operator) to be inferred from all but the first list member.
If that array is possible, it's the resultant type.
If not, an empty array is returned.

If we run our ApplyMoves type on our blank StartingBoard and an array type containing a couple of moves, we get back an output type with those two moves applied.

```ts
type TwoAppliedMoves = ApplyMoves<StartingBoard, [["X", 0, 1], ["O", 2, 2]]>;
/*
{
    0: { 0: " "; 1: "X"; 2: " "; };
    1: { 0: " "; 1: " "; 2: " "; };
    2: { 0: " "; 1: " "; 2: "O"; };
}
*/
```

Amazing! Yes! Hooray! ðŸ™Œ
By harnessing the power of inferred types and joining them with recursive type definitions, we're able to apply a list of moves stored in the type system to a board.
Our output board is the result of all those moves applied on top of each other.

> Get excited for new TypeScript versions!

## Template Literal Types

The last major type system feature we'll look at is also a new one, and is in my opinion one of the stranger â€“though still very usefulâ€“ additions to TypeScript. It's also only available on versions 4.1 later.

Template literal types allow us to check for and extract substrings from inferred string types in the type system.
I'd like to use them to take a starting board and an array of moves, then generate how the board should look after all of them have been applied.
This'll let us simulate a full-on game of Tic Tac Toe based on the move inputs.

```ts
type GameResult = TicTacToe<`
    X 1 1
    O 2 2
    X 2 0
    O 0 2
    X 1 0
    O 0 0
    X 1 2
`>;
```

### Level One: Base Algorithm

Keeping the type system's functional/logical nature in mind, here's my proposal for how we're going to tackle this `TicTacToe` type.

1. First, we'll convert the raw moves description string into a list of move descriptions using a combination of the string template literal types we just saw and the recursive array building technique from applying move tuples.
2. Next, we'll take the `ApplyMoves` type we already wrote out and pass the list of moves to it, to generate an end state board.
3. Finally, we'll pass that end-state board to our already-written `Winner` type to get out the result of who wins.

Here's how that type will look:

```ts
type TicTacToe<Moves extends string> = Winner<
	ApplyMoves<StartingBoard, ParseRawMoves<Moves>>
>;
```

We'll need to write that `ParseRawMoves` type.

### Level Two: String Parsing

In order to convert the raw moves list into an array of `Move`s, we'll need to use steps like the following:

1. Split the steps into an array on `\n` endlines
2. Filter those move lines into an array of usable `Move` tuples

```ts
type ParseRawMoves<Moves extends string> = CollectParsedRawMoves<
	Split<Moves, "\n">,
	[],
	"X"
>;
```

That introduces _two_ types we'll need to implement.

### Level Three: String Splitting

Finally, we get a real example in this blog post of using template literal types:

```ts
type Split<Text extends string, Splitter extends string> = Text extends ""
	? []
	: Text extends `${infer Prefix}${Splitter}${infer Suffix}`
	? [Prefix, ...Split<Suffix, Splitter>]
	: [Text];
```

Our `Split` type takes in a `Text` string and a `Splitter` string.
If the text is empty, then we're done, it gives back an empty array.

Otherwise, it checks for an instance of the `Splitter` string inside the `Text`, allowing any inferred `Prefix` string to come before it and any inferred `Suffix` string to come after it.

Such is the nature of type system template literals: we can check for adherence to string literal types and _extract_ (infer) types as we need.

If there is that inferred matching, the result is first whatever's before the `Splitter` string (`Prefix`), followed by a recursive call to split whatever's after the `Splitter` (`Suffix`).

If the `Splitter` wasn't found, then this string can no longer be split: we return an array containing the all of the Text.

### Level Four: Filtering

Now that we can split the string on endlines, we've got one last challenge ahead of us: turning these lines into raw move descriptions.

The full `CollectParsedRawMoves` type is a little hairy so I've split out a few pieces of logic into helpers shown here:

```ts
// Given a turn, switch to the next (other possible) turn
type NextTurn<Turn> = Turn extends "X" ? "O" : "X";
```

```ts
// Given a string description of a move, give back the number (int) equivalent
// (useful because the inputs are raw strings, but outputs are numbers...)
type IntToString<Int> = Int extends "0"
	? 0
	: Int extends "1"
	? 1
	: Int extends "2"
	? 2
	: never;
```

```ts
// Applies the two above types to parse an input line like 'X 1 2'
type ParseRawMove<Turn, RawRow, RawColumn> = [
	Turn,
	IntToString<RawRow>,
	IntToString<RawColumn>
];
```

Ok dokie!
Here it is!
`CollectParsedRawMoves`!
A type that recursively goes through an array of raw move strings and turns them into our nice Move tuple types:

```ts
type CollectParsedRawMoves<
	RawMoves extends string[],
	Collected extends Move[],
	Turn extends "X" | "O"
> = RawMoves extends []
	? Collected
	: RawMoves[0] extends `${infer Pre}${Turn} ${infer RawRow} ${infer RawColumn}${infer Post}`
	? CollectParsedRawMoves<
			DropFirst<RawMoves>,
			[...Collected, ParseRawMove<Turn, RawRow, RawColumn>],
			NextTurn<Turn>
	  >
	: CollectParsedRawMoves<DropFirst<RawMoves>, Collected, Turn>;
```

It's kind of big, so here's a version with inline comments:

```ts
// Our CollectParsedRawMoves type takes in:
type CollectParsedRawMoves<
	// * the array of raw moves,
	RawMoves extends string[],
	// * the collected moves thus far,
	Collected extends Move[],
	// * and a current turn to parse out of the next raw move.
	Turn extends "X" | "O"
> =
	// If there are no more raw moves to parse out, it's done, hooray!...
	RawMoves extends []
		? // ...we can exit early by returning an empty array.
		  Collected
		: // If there is a next move to parse in our list of raw moves,
		// it checks whether that move matches a usable pattern.
		// There can be any amount of Pre text before the Turn string,
		// followed by a space, the row, another space, the column,
		// then any amount of Post text.
		RawMoves[0] extends `${infer Pre}${Turn} ${infer RawRow} ${infer RawColumn}${infer Post}`
		? // If it did match, we can recursively continue with:
		  CollectParsedRawMoves<
				// * remaining moves yet to be parsed,
				DropFirst<RawMoves>,
				// * the previous collected moves, followed by this new move
				//   (as parsed by our ParseRawMove helper),
				[...Collected, ParseRawMove<Turn, RawRow, RawColumn>],
				// * and the next turn.
				NextTurn<Turn>
		  >
		: // If our raw move doesn't match the template, then we recurse:
		  CollectParsedRawMoves<
				// * still with the rest of the raw moves, but
				DropFirst<RawMoves>,
				// * the same collected moves list (no added one), and
				Collected,
				// * we retry the same move again.
				Turn
		  >;
```

...tada! ðŸŽŠ

There's a good bit of code!
If you're feeling lost in the sea of new complex type syntax, that's great!
Take some time off, come back to this blog or the slides, and persevere â€“ you'll be able to get through it, and you'll have a more clear understanding of it all if you do.

All concepts are new until you've had the time to play with them for a bit. Everything is complex until you get it.

## What's Next

By now, you have at the very least a healthy appreciation for the power of TypeScript's type system, and ideally a better understanding of how to use it to boot.

If you want to grow your type system chops a bit, the [Type Challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges) repository is a great place to up your game.
It presents a series of increasingly difficult tasks in the type system for you to play with.

### DefinitelyTyped

Lastly, I'd like to give a friendly plug for [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped): the open source repository storing TypeScript type definitions for packages that don't ship with their own.

It's a huge repository with _thousands_ of open issues, ready for you to tackle.
If you use any JavaScript libraries that aren't (yet?) written in TypeScript, applying the fun concepts you saw here today to flesh them out is a wonderful way to spend your time.

## Closing Thoughts

I'd love to see what fun advances in this game engine exploration you come up with.
Please, [tag me @JoshuaKGoldberg](https://twitter.com/JoshuaKGoldberg) with your results!
A few starting suggestions might be:

- A win/loss calculator for a list of game strings?
- Game AI to generate a next move?
- Expanding to games like Connect Four, Checkers, Chess, or Boggle?
- Ignoring whatever I say and doing something completely different!?

Thanks for making it this far in the blog post.
I hope it served some use to you in exploring the TypeScript type system!
