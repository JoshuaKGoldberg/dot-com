Hi!
You might have been linked this blog post in a pull request that has a lot of changes in it.
There might be a request linking to this blog post, asking that you split out some or all of those unrelated changes from it.

This blog post is an explainer for why to split out unrelated changes from reviews.

## Split Out Unrelated Changes

For the most part, the larger a pull request, the longer it will take to review and get merged.
Larger pull requests generally come with more cost and more risk than smaller PRs.
They also clutter the Git history for files, making it harder to search back over time to see why logic changed when.

> ðŸ‘‰ See [Why Open Source Pull Requests Can Take A While](https://www.joshuakgoldberg.com/blog/open-source-pull-request-timing) for why open source pull requests in particular can take a long time.

Anything we can do to reduce that cost is helpful.
My favorite strategies in particular are:

- Instead of one PR that resolves multiple issues at once, it can often be better to send one PR for each one of those issues.
- Separating changes that impact code logic out from changes that only impact layout, formatting, or style.

## One Pull Request Per Task

It's generally easier to review a pull request that resolves one task (e.g. GitHub issue) rather than a pull request that resolves multiple tasks.
Each area of change you add to a pull request increases the size and complexity of the pull request, making longer and more convoluted to review.
It becomes harder to keep track of which changes apply to which task as a pull request grows in size.

As a general ideology, I try to make each of my pull requests address a single GitHub issue.
There should be one granular `fixes #<number>` in the pull request description per GitHub's docs on [linking a pull request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

### Working with Automation

Furthermore, many repositories -including most of mine- automatically generate changelogs and new releases.
Granular pull requests can become individual changelog entries and releases.
Catch-all pull requests don't fit well into those systems.

As a general rule, I try to make sure all my pull requests can be described in a single [conventional commits message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0).
If you can't describe your pull request with a title like a `feat: add option to abc` or `fix: avoid crash when xyz` then it might be a sign of an overloaded set of changes.

## Separate Logical and Stylistic Changes

Stylistic changes generally don't require very much review time per line of code changed.
Teams sometimes take a long time to discuss their stylistic preferences, but once those discussions are resolved, changing code to adhere to new styles is often straightforward.

Logical changes to code, on the other hand, generally take much longer to review.
Which is good: logical changes come with a much higher risk of bugs.
Every changed line of code in a pull request that changes logic should be scrutinized to make sure it doesn't break something.

Introducing stylistic changes in a logical PR makes that those stylistically changed lines appear to need scrutiny.
Reviewers will have to remember that those lines aren't logically changed in reviews.
That's a tax that slows down review of the PR.

Consider trying to understand this large set of changes to a `repeatMessage` function:

```diff
-export function repeatMessage(
-       times: number,
-       ...messages: string[]
-) {
-        for (let i = 0; i < times; i += 1)
-               for (const message of messages)
+export function repeatMessage(times: number, messages: string[]) {
+        for (let i = 0; i < times; i += 1) {
+               for (const message of messages) {
                        console.log(message);
+               }
+       }
 }
```

Now consider this version of the same change but with only logical differences:

```diff
-export function repeatMessage(times: number, ...messages: string[]) {
+export function repeatMessage(times: number, messages: string[]) {
        for (let i = 0; i < times; i += 1) {
                for (const message of messages) {
                        console.log(message);
```

Much easier and faster to read through, right?
All that was being changed was removing the `...` -- but the first diff obfuscated that straightforward intent with misleading stylistic changes.

### Automate Stylistic Preferences (If Possible)

Co-opting logical pull requests to enforce stylistic preferences is not an efficient way to roll out those preferences.
Stylistic preferences lend themselves well to automation.
Trying to touch them up one-by-one is sisyphean: a never-ending expenditure of effort that yields little to no real results.

Formatters and linters are pretty good at **automating** most stylistic conventions.
If you want to enforce a stylistic preference, do so with as much automation as possible.

Most of the `repeatMessage` formatting from earlier could be enforced with any common formatter such as [Prettier](https://prettier.io) and linter such as [ESLint](https://eslint.org).
I personally include [typescript-eslint's `stylisticTypeChecked` config](https://typescript-eslint.io/users/configs#stylistic-type-checked) along with Prettier plugins such as [prettier-plugin-curly](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/prettier-plugin-curly) to enforce a large set of consistency preferences in my projects.

## Everything in Balance

These are't absolute rules.
Sometimes the convenience of including a small unrelated change in a pull request is worth more than the benefits of splitting up changes.

Filing an issue and reviewing a pull request both take time.
If that time is greater than the cost of adding a small unrelated change to a pull request, then it may be worth it to just stick with the one pull request.

If I'm already refactoring an area of code, and touching up some stylistic preferences wouldn't bloat the pull request too much, I might throw them in.
Especially if those changes aren't something that need to be applied elsewhere in the repository.

When including an unrelated change in a pull request, I recommend explicitly adding a comment explaining why it's there.
That might convince a reviewer that it is indeed worth it to keep the changes together.
At the very least it will explain your thought process and make the choice seem intentional rather than mistaken.
