Today's web linters are great.
[ESLint](https://eslint.org) is robust and has a huge ecosystem of plugins and configs.
Newer native speed linters such as [Biome](https://biomejs.dev), [`deno lint`](https://lint.deno.land), and [Oxlint](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc) are fast and easy to set up with their own burgeoning ecosystems.

I've been working on TypeScript linting for almost a decade.
I started contributing to [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint) community projects in 2016 and am now a number of the [typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) and [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) teams.
Based on those years of various linters, I've collected a large set of design ideas that I want to see in a new web linter.

I see a linter that is **fast by default**, **powerful upon request**, and **straightforward to configure**.
This post is how I would architect it.

## Formatting Coordination

One of the biggest reasons users move to Biome or Oxc is that those tools perform both _formatting_ and _linting_ with a single devDependency and configuration file.
In doing so, they provide a much easier setup and maintenance story, as well as sidestep many common ESLint misconfigurations that lead to performance issues [^tseslint-troubleshooting-performance-stylistic] [^tseslint-troubleshooting-performance-prettier] [^tseslint-troubleshooting-performance-import].

I think that's a great idea.
I still believe _lint rules_ should not be used for formatting [^post-stop-using-eslint-for-formatting] [^post-the-blurry-line-between-formatting-and-style].
But I've found that if I want to format a file type, there's practically always a linter plugin I'd want for it too.
If both the formatter and linter are running on the same set of files, deduplicating _coordination_ into the linter makes sense to me.

If I wrote a linter, it would provide "postlint" hooks for tasks on those files [^eslint-issue-change-request-add-a-concept-of-postlint-hooks].
By default it would at least run a formatter on files after linting them.
You wouldn't need to include formatting-specific configuration files in your repository at all.
Formatting would be wholly coordinated by the linter.

## Hybrid Core

I want the fantastic performance benefits of recent native speed linters.
I also want the developer approachability benefits of writing all rules -not just select userland plugins- in TypeScript.

If I wrote a linter, it would have a **hybrid core**:

- _File intake_ and _type information_ would be native speed, for performance
- _Coordinating logic_ and _rules_ would be TypeScript, to stay approachable for developers

[Hybrid Linters: The Best of Both Worlds](/blog/hybrid-linters-the-best-of-both-worlds) covers this in more detail.

## TypeScript For Type Awareness

TypeScript is the only tool that can provide full TypeScript type information for JavaScript or TypeScript code [^post-why-typed-linting-needs-typescript-today].
Typed linting's performance with TypeScript 5.x is troublesome today even for projects that configure it correctly.
It still feels slow even on linters optimized for it such as [TSSLint](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/tsslint).

Good thing [TypeScript's Go port](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port) is coming with _10x performance improvements_.
I believe a linter that uses the 10x faster TypeScript in Go _and_ has built-in support for typed linting would make typed linting well worth its performance cuts.

### TypeScript FFI

If a Node.js linter that wants to call to native Go code, it has roughly three common options:

- [FFI (Foreign Function Interface)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface): running TypeScript's Go functions within the linting process
- [IPC (Inter-Process Communication)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication): creating a separate TypeScript Go process
- [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly): compiling TypeScript's Go code to WebAssembly to be run in the linter process

WebAssembly would be ideal -- except Go's output is still suboptimal for this use case [^go-performance-of-wasm] [^typescript-go-wasm-performance].

IPC's isolated processes are much generally easier to work with.
But, IPC is slower than FFI because it has to serialize and deserialize data between the two processes.

FFI is tricky because Go code works in a single shared memory space.
Users running the linter would be stuck with whatever version of TypeScript and Go is bundled with the linter.

If I wrote a linter, it would use FFI for as fast type information as possible (until Go's WebAssembly story is more favorable).
If users are running other Go code, they can always spawn a dedicated process for the linter.

## Type Aware, Always

Many popular lint rules require typed linting to avoid blatant bugs or feature gaps [^eslint-plugin-react-hooks-detection-typed-linting] [^eslint-plugin-vitest-valid-type-type-checking].
But, ESLint core and its rules are not type-aware.
Enabling typed linting requires reading additional documentation and implementing additional linter config setup.
Avoiding common configuration pitfalls [^tseslint-troubleshooting-typed-linting] in that setup is not a straightforward task.

The divide between untyped core rules and typed plugin rules is painful for the ecosystem:

- Core rules are less powerful than they could be
- Plugins have to choose between being fast and easy to set up vs. slower and type-aware
- ESLint core isn't structured for cross-file linting, so there are known typed linting performance woes [^eslint-rfc-feat-parsing-session-objects] and intractable editor extension bugs [^vscode-eslint-cross-file-information]

Those extra configuration steps and performance woes are two of the big reasons why typed linting is an optional add-in for most projects.
Given this hypothetical linter's hybrid core, typed linting would be significantly faster and much easier to set up.
Removing typed linting's downsides means the linter could make type information always available.
That would simplify the linting story:

- Core rules don't need to be duplicated by plugins to add in typed linting support
- Plugins don't have to depend on an ad-hoc non-core project for type information
- The core linter architecture can be optimized for type-checked linting performance

If I wrote a linter, an equivalent of [typescript-eslint's new Project Service](https://typescript-eslint.io/blog/announcing-typescript-eslint-v8#project-service) would always be enabled for users.
And with a core architecture optimized for typed linting, linting can be just as fast as type checking.
Whoo!

## Built-In TypeScript Support

ESLint is one of the few common modern JavaScript utilities that doesn't support parsing TypeScript syntax out-of-the-box.
Although core rules react well to parsed TypeScript syntax now [^eslint-issue-change-request-make-core-rules-typescript-syntax-aware], your configuration must use typescript-eslint to actually parse that syntax.
Core ESLint rules also don't understand TypeScript types or concepts.

That's led to the concept of "extension rules" in typescript-eslint [^tseslint-extension-rules]: rules that replace built-in rules to work well with TypeScript syntax and/or types.
Extension rules are confusing for users and inconvenient to work with for both maintainers and users.

I'm excited that ESLint is rethinking its TypeScript support [^rethinking-typescript-support-in-eslint].
Hopefully, once the ESLint rewrite [^eslint-discussion-rewrite] comes out, we'll be able to declutter userland configs and deduplicate the extension rules.

If I wrote a linter, it would support TypeScript natively.
No additional packages or "extension" rules.
Core rules would understand both TypeScript syntax and type information.

### TypeScript's AST

ESLint's AST representation is [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree).
[`@typescript-eslint/parser`](https://typescript-eslint.io/packages/parser) works by parsing code using TypeScript's parser into TypeScript's AST, then recursively creating a "TSESTree" (ESTree + TypeScript nodes) structure roughly adhering to ESTree from that.

We do this because both of those ASTs are necessary in ESLint's model:

- ESTree: means lint rules have no dependency on the corporate-backed TypeScript -- they are compatible with ESLint core
- TypeScript's: must be used for nodes passed to TypeScript APIs, most notably for typed linting

The main downside of this dual-tree format is the complication for linter teams and lint rule authors working with TypeScript APIs.
On the typescript-eslint team, we must dedicate time for every TypeScript AST change to update node conversion logic.
For lint rule authors, having to convert TSESTree nodes to their TS counterparts before passing to TypeScript APIs is an annoyance.
We've written utilities to help with common cases [^tseslint-pr-type-checker-wrapper-apis] but the conceptual overhead alone is bad enough.

TypeScript is now the only popular type-oriented language in web code -- there's no longer a strong need to keep lint rules extensible for other languages such as Flow [^flow-blog-clarity-on-direction].
As much as I like the goal of remaining ESTree/JavaScript-oriented in JavaScript linters, this dual-tree overhead is awful.
I want to make the acts of writing lint rules as streamlined as possible.

If I wrote a linter, it would create only one AST for JavaScript and TypeScript code: TypeScript's.

## Core Common Languages

Building in TypeScript support is a great start, but linting is useful for more than just JavaScript and TypeScript.
ESLint plugins exist for basically every language that web repositories use.
I think a modern web linter should encourage applying the same developer assistance and quality checks to all the languages in a project.

If I wrote a linter, it would support all languages that are common to the majority of web projects:

- JavaScript and TypeScript
- JSON
- Markdown
- YML

This means the core linter architecture would be completely agnostic of any specific language.
It would look like the newer ESLint architecture where each language is its own plugin [^eslint-discussion-rewrite] [^eslint-rfc-language-plugins].
Users would of course still be able to write their own plugins for other languages such as Astro and Vue.

## Embeddable by Design

Right now, most web projects that employ both linting and type checking run them separately in CI.
Projects typically either run them in parallel across two workflows or in series within the same workflow.
That's inefficient and slow.

The root problem is that projects typically don't connect the type information generated by type checking (`tsc`) to typed linting in ESLint.
Projects effectively run a full type-check twice: once with `tsc` and once with typed linting.

Other folks have already started working on this problem.
[typescript-eslint-language-service](https://github.com/Quramy/typescript-eslint-language-service) is a direction I'd already like to explore in working more closely with typescript-eslint.
[TSSLint](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/tsslint) is a recent project that does a great job of integrating with tsserver.

If I wrote a linter, it would have native support for embedding within TypeScript as a [language service plugin](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#plugins).
I'm not sure yet how this would look -does this happen client-side and CI? only CI?- but I think the potential to deduplicate type information computation in CI is tantalizing.

## Rich Cross File Fixes

A linter is in many ways the best codemod platform for many kinds of migrations.
It allows you to define a granular, testable set of migration rules, and then keep them enforced over time so developers don't add regressions.
I've personally used lint rules to great effect in rolling out design system updates, enforcement of best practices, and other niceties.

Unfortunately, the "one file at a time" model all of today's linters doesn't lend itself well to all the operations a codemod might need.
Rules may need to make fixes or suggestions to files other than the one being linted [^eslint-issue-change-request-apply-suggestions-to-other-files].
ESLint also doesn't provide very many hooks for changing which fixes and/or suggestions are applied yet [^eslint-rfc-per-rule-autofix-configuration].

If I wrote a linter, I would add in a rich system for rule fixes and suggestions:

- The ability to indicate changes to virtual files other than the one being linted
- Other file system operations, such as renames and permissions changes
- Targeting specific fixes and/or suggestions programmatically

Between ESLint's new [Bulk Suppressions](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/suppressions) and the controllable fixes & suggestions, I think this linter would allow teams to integrate gradual codemod-driven migrations into daily development.

## Up Next

I find this post's architecture ideas exhilarating and terrifying.
They're a huge departure from the current state of web linting, even stepping in the opposite direction of other linters in many cases.
But I think the potential advantages are huge:

- Combining the performance of native speed with the joy of TypeScript-first lint rules
- Deduplicating type information computation in CI from 2 jobs to 1
- Reducing the amount of language plugins from >=2 to 1 for common projects
- Removing the need for wholly separate codemod platforms
- Shrinking the config files, devDependencies, scripts for formatting+linting down to 1

Over the next ~week, I'll post more about the developer experience and ecosystem points of this hypothetical linter.
If this post was of any interest to you I think you'll find them similarly interesting!
