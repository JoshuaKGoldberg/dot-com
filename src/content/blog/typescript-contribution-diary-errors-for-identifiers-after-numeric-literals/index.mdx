Problem Statement
It's been a while since I poked into TypeScript and I had some free time, so I wanted to challenge myself.
This contribution involved going a bit deeper into TypeScript parsing and scanning.
To find the issue, I had searched for issues with both the [`Effort: Moderate`](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/labels/Effort%3A%20Moderate) and [`help wanted`](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/labels/help%20wanted) tags, then sorted by oldest ([issues query link](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Effort%3A+Moderate%22+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+sort%3Acreated-asc)).
One from 2015 seemed interesting:

> [#4702](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/4702): IdentifierStart cannot occur following a NumericLiteral

Rephrasing the issue post: according to the ECMA specification, section [11.8.3 ‚Äî NumericLiterals](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-literals-numeric-literals), the _SourceCharacter_ after a _NumericLiteral_ must not be an _IdentifierStart_.
For example:

- **`3in`**: should become an error, not be considered the same as `3 in` _(referring to checking whether 3 exists in something)_
- `let hasFour = 3in[null, null, null, null];` as an expansion of ‚òù

### tl;dr

You need a space between number literals (`3`) and identifiers or keywords (`a`, `in`).
`3in` is bad; `3 in` is allowed.

### Terminology

What on Earth do those terms mean?

- _**SourceCharacter**_: Skimming through the ECMA specification with Ctrl+F to find other places it's mentioned, it seem to refer to the characters in the source code ‚Äî makes sense, given the name.
- _**NumericLiteral**_: `ts.SyntaxKind.NumericLiteral` refers to numbers you type out, such as `123` _(regular floats)_, `1_234_567` _(floats with separators)_, and _1234n_ _([BigInts](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint))_.
  A "literal" generally refers to built-in primitive values such as booleans, numbers, or strings.
- _**IdentifierStart**_: Generally refers to the name of something, such as a variable or class.
  Let's interpret that in this context to mean any name is either some built-in keyword (such as `in`) or an identifier (such as `a`).

For _NumericLiteral_ and _IdentifierStart_, you can see the equivalent `NumericLiteral` and `Identifier` nodes by copy & pasting into [ts-ast-viewer](https://ts-ast-viewer.com):

```ts
let value = 7;
```

It shows that `value` is an _Identifier_ node _(in this case, the name of a variable)_ and `7` is a _NumericLiteral_.

If you copy a simple example like `3in[null]` into ts-ast-explorer, it shows a tree with nodes (and syntax highlighting) equivalent to `3 in [null]`.
Looks like the goal for this issue is to add a check after the numeric literal to make sure there's not what could be the start of an identifier.

## Enter the Compiler

_How does TypeScript parse in a source file and convert that into an AST?_

According to the [Basarat Gitbook](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/compiler/overview.html), that's the well-named `src/parser.ts` and `src/scanner.ts` in the TypeScript source.

- The **parser** is the driving force to understand a source file.
  It uses the scanner to read in nodes, then puts them together as an AST.
- The **scanner** is used by the parser each time a new node needs to be read into the tree and parsed.
  It keeps track of the source text and character position within it.

### Starting Point

_How does TypeScript launch the parsing and scanning of a file?_

Skimming through `parser.ts` in order, we see...

1. A few type declarations, such as `enum Signature Flags`
1. Public node utilities such as `visitNodes` and `forEachChild`
1. A `createSourceFile` function that takes file name, text, and some other things to create a `SourceFile`

...that seems promising!
It also has some `performance.mark`ers around parsing, which we can assume help log timing around how long important operations take.
Seems like a good place to look into.
In order, this function:

1. Calls to `Parser.parseSourceFile` _(that's a good sign too!)_, which...
1. Calls `parseSourceFileWorker` for non-JSON files, which...
1. Creates a new blank `sourceFile` with `createSourceFile`, processes pragmas, creates `sourceFile.statements` with `parseList`, and sets some metadata on the source file.

I don't know or care about pragmas or miscellaneous source file metadata, but based on AST viewing websites, the `statements` property contains the root-level nodes of the file.
`parseList` must therefore be the place that creates these nodes, so it must call things that parse nodes.

`parseList` takes in a `parseElement` lambda that it passes to `parseListElement`, which will either call some `consumeNode` function or `parseElement`.

_Question: which is relevant?_
_Do we care about consumeNode or parseElement?_

### Aside: Debugging

At this point, someone capable with JavaScript tooling might attach debugger breakpoints and debug through TypeScript to answer that question.

_Not me!_

I just wanted to quickly modify the compiled TypeScript code and re-run it to print out which things are being used without having to worry about setting up debugging _(about which I am clueless)_.
My setup instead consisted of:

- `C:/Code/typescript`: A Git cloned repository for navigating the source.
  I'd made it [globally npm linked](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-link) with `npm link` and built with `npm run build`.
- `C:/Code/tsdevtest`: Stub project with a minimal `package.json` and `index.ts`.
  I'd symlinked it to TypeScript with `npm link typescript`.

`index.ts` contained a simple test case:

```ts
let hasFour = 3in[null]
```

With this setup, running `tsc index.ts` in `C:/Code/tsdevtest` uses `C:/Code/typescript/lib/tsc.js`.

I also added the following line at the beginning of `createSourceFile`:

```js
global.wat = fileName === "index.ts";
```

That line creates a global variable named `wat` which is only true for files named `index.ts`.
Later on in the code, running `wat && console.log(":)")` would only print while parsing `index.ts`.

_This is useful because TypeScript will also compile files containing built-in types, such as `lib.d.ts`._
_Running with `--noLib` removes them but results in "Cannot find global type Array" and similar errors if parsing succeeds._

### Back to the Hunt

...anyway, we wanted to see how nodes are parsed out of the source file, and were looking at `parseListElement` to see which sub-function it calls.
I put a `wat && console.log("consumeNode")` before return `consumeNode(node)`; and a `wat && console.log("parseElement")` before `return parseElement();`.

<LabeledImage
	alt="Running 'type index.ts & tsc index.ts' in C:\Code\tsdevtest. There are three output lines of parseElement."
	description="Three parseElements and no consumeNodes."
	src={tsdevtestParseElementThrice}
/>

üò≤
Only `parseElement` was being printed, so only `parseStatement` was being called to.
It contains a `switch` statement that, depending on the value of `token()`, can call a bunch of different `parse*` functions, or default to `parseExpressionOrLabeledStatement`.

The `token` function returns a variable named `currentToken`, of type `SyntaxKind`, so it seems safe to assume this is the current syntax kind being parsed.
It's parsed with `scanner.scan`, which we know from the [Basarat Gitbook Scanner page](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/overview/scanner) starts at the starting index of a node and finds the end of it.
`scan` contains another switch statement over a `ch` variable, which is the character code of the _SourceCharacter_ being looked at.

Given that the relevant contents for parsing start with `3in`, `ch` would have to be `"3".charCodeAt(0)`, or 51, for the start of parsing `3` as a NumericLiteral.
`tsc.js` showed a `case 51`: as compiled from an equivalent line in `scanner.ts`: `case CharacterCodes._3:`.
That line calls to `scanNumber`.

...so the function that scans a number to be parsed is `scanNumber`.
üí™

### Number Scanning

_How does `scanNumber` scan source code into NumericLiterals?_

`scanNumber` was about 50 lines of real code and kind of hard to understand.
My first guesses squinting through its first three root-level `if` statements were that they, in order:

1. Check if the number starts with a `.`, such as with .5
1. Check if the number is a "scientific" number, meaning it starts with `E` or `e`, such as with `1e3` (1000)
1. Check if the number has a `_` separator

The last `if`/`else` pair checks whether the number is a decimal or scientific:

- If either, it returns a numeric literal
- If neither, it checks whether it's a BigInt before returning

Awesome!
Here is the one place where a _NumericLiteral_ may be created.
Just be sure, I added a `wat && console.log("Result:", result)` at the end:

<LabeledImage
	alt="Running 'type index.ts & tsc index.ts' in C:\Code\tsdevtest. There is three output line, Result: 3."
	description="Result: 3."
	src={tsdevtestResult3}
/>

Confirmed.
Great.

## Checking for Identifiers

_How can we know whether the next token is an identifier?_

In theory, we could check if the character code of the next thing is an a-Z letter, but there are almost certainly esoteric rules around that.
How does the scanner scan in an identifier, rather than a numeric literal?
Presumably there must be some internal TypeScript logic that checks whether we're starting with an identifier?

Going back to `scan`, the `default` case for any character code not handled as a special character immediately calls to an `isIdentifierStart` function.
`isIdentifierStart` checks if the character code is within A-Z or a-z, is $ or \_ _(which are valid name starters)_, is a high-valued ASCII character, or is a unicode identifier.
I don't know what those last two mean but that looks like the right place!

### Reinforced Number Scanning

Per a previous post of mine that included how to add diagnostics, I made a new diagnostic:

```json
"An identifier cannot follow a numeric literal.": {
	"category": "Error",
	"code": 1351
},
```

...and in `scanNumber`, before the `if`/`else` returns, added:

```js
if (isIdentifierStart(text.charCodeAt(pos), languageVersion)) {
	error(Diagnostics.An_identifier_cannot_follow_a_numeric_literal, pos, 1);
}
```

Upon running `tsc index.ts`, voila!
The error showed!

<LabeledImage
	alt="Running 'type index.ts & tsc index.ts' in C:\Code\tsdevtest. An error, 'An identifier cannot follow a numeric literal.', is reported on the 'i' after the 3 in let hasFour = 3in[null]"
	description="It never stops feeling amazing to give myself errors."
	src={tsdevtest3inError}
/>

## Test Time

Per my previous post on [verifying parser changes](/blog/typescript-contribution-diary-trailing-type-parameter), TypeScript has a "baselines" system where you check in source files with expected types and errors.
I added a `tests/cases/compiler/identifierStartAfterNumericLiteral.ts` to explicitly test these changes:

```ts
let valueIn = 3in[null]
```

...but after re-running `jake baseline`, there were new errors found in a _bunch_ of files, such as `bigIntIndex.errors.txt`.
üò¢

...which reminded me, BigInts such as 1n are valid numbers I should verify still work.
Adding a `3in[null]`, `3nin[null]`, `1e9`, and `1n` to index.ts:

<LabeledImage
	alt="Running 'type index.ts & tsc index.ts' in C:\Code\tsdevtest. Four raw logs: 3in[null], 3nin[null], 1e9, 1n. Three 'An identifier cannot follow a numeric literal' errors on the character after a number: 3in[null], 3nin[null], 1n."
	description="Errors for bigints! That's not good."
	src={tsdevtestVariousErrors}
/>

üòï.
It looks like TypeScript thought in the second and third cases that `n` was starting a new identifier instead of whatever was after the number.

A few minutes of cursing and poking around `scanNumber` later, I noticed that `checkBigIntSuffix` increments `pos` for the case of it finding an n suffix.
Brain blast!
üí° Aha!
We can't know what the end position of the number is until after we've scanned past any last `n`; checking for a subsequent _IdentifierStart_ therefore has to come after.

I extracted the new logic into a `checkForIdentifierAfterNumericLiteral` method and called it immediately before each `return` in `scanNumber`.

<LabeledImage
	alt="Running 'type index.ts & tsc index.ts' in C:\Code\tsdevtest. Six raw logs: 3in[null], 3nin[null], 1e9, 1n, 1e9in[null], 1nin[null]. Four 'An identifier cannot follow a numeric literal' errors on the character after a number: 3in[null], 3nin[null], 1e9in[null], 1nin[null]."

## The Pull Request

> [Added error for IdentifierStart immediately after a NumericLiteral by Josh Goldberg ¬∑ Pull Request #28857](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/28857):

A couple pieces of feedback were given on the pull request:

- The whole identifier, not the first character of it, should be complained on.
- The error message was a little vague.

Sounds reasonable.
I updated the error message pretty simply.
Expanding the red squiggly was a little less straightforward...

### Full Identifier Complaints

In order to have the error messages' span length contain the full identifier, it's necessary to know how long the identifier is.
That necessitates reading in the identifier using whatever logic TypeScript would normally use.

I didn't already know where to find this, but numbers are scanned in with `scanNumber`, it made sense to first check for `scanIdentifier`.

...which doesn't exist...

...but a `scanIdentifierParts` does exist, which consists of a `while` loop that continuously advances as long as it finds characters that match a function named `isIdentifierPart` or some complicated things following a character matching `CharacterCodes.backslash`.
Seems legit.

One issue with scanning for an identifier is that the `scanIdentifierParts` function updates `pos` normally, even though we didn't want to actually skip parsing the new identifier.
I solved this by keeping track of `pos`' original value and restoring it after the function was called.

I added a few test cases for identifiers of longer lengths and updated the PR.

The PR was merged in and a followup issue filed to help improve the diagnostic messages even more.
Hooray!
üéâ

_Maybe I'll tackle that other issue another day..._

## Key Takeaways

- It's totally fine, sometimes even better, to use console.log debugging in a pinch!
  _(though I love debuggers for longer use)_
- Understand your edge cases: numbers are complicated.
- Pay attention to your error messages.

It's worth it to help your users understand their exact errors.

### A Note on Streamlining

It was commented to me after my last two posts that the progression of steps documented in them could make it appear that I effortlessly glided through the investigations linearly, without any real _"I'm stumped."_ moments.
Not so!
I intentionally omit dead ends in the from these blog posts because they would be seven times as long.
I have little to no idea what I'm doing.
