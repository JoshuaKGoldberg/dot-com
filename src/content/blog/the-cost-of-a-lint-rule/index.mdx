I un-drafted a tricky pull request this morning.
[feat(eslint-plugin): [no-unnecessary-type-parameters] initial implementation](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/8173): resolving a nearly three-year-old feature request on [typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io) to add a lint rule that detects violations of [The Golden Rule of Generics](https://effectivetypescript.com/2020/08/12/generics-golden-rule).

That PR started off pleasant: a pairing session with Dan Vanderkam and hopes of having it ready in advance of his _[Effective TypeScript](https://effectivetypescript.com)_ second edition.
It ended up being much more complicated than we'd hoped and draining a bunch of both of our time.
Such is life in software development.

## Monetary Cost

Speaking just for myself, this rule took about two and a half days of work to get into review.
For the sake of easy math let's suppose my compensation should be $100/hour (a reasonable total compensation for senior developers in the US).
Calculating roughly six hours of work per day, that's 2.5 days &times; 6 hours / day &times; $100/hour = **$1,500**.

That's not even factoring in Dan's time, time it'll take at least one other project maintainer to review the code, time spent improving the rule based on code review, etc.

The monetary compensation cost of this lint rule rule will be **well over two thousand dollars**.

## Opportunity Cost

Most tasks in software development are fairly straightforward _if_ you've practiced them a bunch.
My normal flow is to take on several "shallow" tasks at a time and context switch during long-running tasks.
That's how I'm able to be effective on multiple open source projects at a time.

But, sometimes you come across a task that involves work you're not deeply practiced in.
For "deep" tasks, you need to put aside other work and focus on slow and steady progress.

I ended up putting aside several other important, time-sensitive commitments to focus on this darn lint rule.
Instead of context switching, I would step away from the computer to think deeply or clear my mind.

There's no good way to estimating what I would have been able to do instead of this lint rule.

## Sponsoring Open Source

There are many good reasons to sponsor open source development: to improve software supply chain security, to reward developers for their time, to encourage more people to get into open source, ...
Letting full-time maintainers like me focus on deep tasks like this is one of them.

I'm only able to spend many hours a day on open source projects such as typescript-eslint because of monetary sponsorships.
If I had to go back to consulting or employment to support myself, I would not have the time to regularly tackle deep work like this.

Most open source software projects have teeny development costs compared to the amount of bug reports and feature requests they receive.
[typescript-eslint's annual Open Collective budget](https://opencollective.com/typescript-eslint) has never exceeded $50,000.

So, the next time you üëç a request on an open source project's GitHub issue tracker, think about how much money that feature request will cost.
It might be a lot more than you'd think.
