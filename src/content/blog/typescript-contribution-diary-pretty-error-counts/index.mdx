## Problem Statement

TypeScript Issue 22124: [Provide summary of errors when in — pretty mode?](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/22124)
When refactoring large projects, the CLI output from compile runs (both from solo compiles and `--watch`) can build up pretty quickly.
Every time I save a file it feels like the terminal is filling up with a giant sea of angry errors.
It would be convenient to have an error around the lines of "`Found 43 errors in 21 files.`" at the bottom of each compile to help track progress.

Here's what a `--pretty --watch` run with errors looks like now:

<LabeledImage
	alt="TypeScript --pretty --watch output showing colors on file locators and red squigglies, but no error summary at the end"
	src={tscPrettyWatchBefore}
/>

{/* TODO (markdown): 🌈 #humblebrag 🌈 */}

_Time to debug!_

## Step 1: Where

_Where should TypeScript print the list of error messages?_

Presumably, there must be something that prints out each of the error messages in order.
The messages only have some of this fancy formatting in `--pretty` mode, so I figured it'd be easier to look for whatever prints that stuff and see who calls it.
Two unique, search-friendly features of `--pretty` printing are:

- `~` underlines underneath error messages
- Special console colors

I ran a search on "`~`" and found a few places in `src/compiler/program.ts`, all within a function named `formatDiagnosticsWithColorAndContext`.
Perfect!

I put a `console.log("Found", diagnostics.length, "errors");` at the bottom of `formatDiagnosticsWithColorAndContext` and ran the compiler on a project with two errors across two files to see the message being printed twice:

<LabeledImage
	alt="TypeScript --pretty --watch output showing colors on file locators and red squigglies, and 'Found 1 complaints' just before each of the two file complaints"
	description="Aww..."
	src={tscPrettyWatch1Complaints}
/>

So it looks like `formatDiagnosticsWithColorAndContext` gets run on every file.
Not on every run.
Not so perfect.
😦

A full-text search showed it only ever being called in `createDiagnosticReporter` in `src/compiler/watch.ts`.
That is called by `createWatchCompilerHostOfConfigFile`, which passes it as a reportDiagnostic parameter to `createWatchCompilerHost`.
Within _that_ function it's only ever used within a new function named `emitFilesAndReportErrorUsingBuilder`, which passes it to `emitFilesAndReportErrors`.

I put the same console message in the new location and again ran the compiler on the same project.
This time there was a single message at the end about two complaints:

<LabeledImage
	alt="TypeScript --pretty --watch output showing colors on file locators and red squigglies, and 'Found 2 complaints' without formatting after the list of type errors"
	description="🎉🎉🎉"
	src={tscPrettyWatch2ComplaintsPlain}
/>

Hooray!
Found the place.

## Step 2: How?

_How to print all the errors?_

I wanted to print both the count of errors and count of files.
The first part seemed to already be solved by the count of diagnostics.
Remaining to do was to count the unique file names from the diagnostics, create some kind of diagnostic message about the results, and print that message.

### 2.1: Counting Unique File Names

The `Diagnostic` type has a field `file: SourceFile | undefined` and the `SourceFile` type has a field `fileName: string`.
I figured that was a reasonable source of information on file names.
But counting them?

Counting unique objects is generally optimally efficient in JavaScript with a [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set).
I ran full-text searches on `new Set` and `Set.from` but didn't find anything... which makes sense, as TypeScript works in environments that don't natively have Set.
But surely there must be _something_ in TypeScript for counting unique objects? What about the slightly-older [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)?

I tried again searching for `new Map` and found two generic, useful-looking functions at the top of `src/compiler/core.ts`:

- `createDictionaryObject`
- `createMap`

> Maps are useful when you want a dictionary-like object but can't guarantee you won't have have to check edge case key names such as "`hasOwnProperty`".
> That tends to happen when you're coding a superset of JavaScript.

`createMap` uses `createDictionaryObject` internally to satisfy the `Map` interface.
Looks like TypeScript polyfills `Map`.
I haven't personally executed reliable performance tests to evaluate which is faster, but if TypeScript has a function to choose between the two options, I figured it would make sense to go along with whatever TypeScript used.

Conclusion: use `createMap` to keep track of unique file names with errors.

### 2.2: Localizing Error and File Counts

The diagnostic messages stored by TypeScript in `diagnosticInformationMap.generated.ts` are string templates without any logic for pluralization logic.
That's a little inconvenient as I wanted to print a different message in each of three singular/plural possibilities:

- Single error, single file
- Multiple errors, single file
- Multiple errors, multiple files

Three new strings it was.

The [contribution guide's section on localization](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/b87e3018226262ea195a56abfb000a80b92c8f8c/CONTRIBUTING.md#localization) mentions that those strings come from `src/compiler/diagnosticMessages.json` and are generated by the `jake generate-diagnostics` command.
For example:

```json
"Compilation complete. Watching for file changes.": {
    "category": "Message",
    "code": 6042
},
```

The "`code`" field is interesting.
There are codes around that compilation message from `6001` to `6190`, then gaps around. I assumed this was some kind of organization strategy and added the three new messages in `6191`-`6193`:

- `Found_1_error_in_1_file: diag(6191, ...)`
- `Found_0_errors_in_1_file: diag(6192, ...)`
- `Found_0_errors_in_1_files: diag(6193, ...)`

_Later, I thought to click the [Diagnostics guidelines link](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines#diagnostic-messages) in CONTRIBUTING.md..._

### 2.3 Diagnostics Printing

Other diagnostics in `emitFilesAndReportErrors` are printed via a function named `reportDiagnostic`.
I tried using that to print the new summary message but got a different-looking message prefix:

<LabeledImage
	alt="TypeScript --pretty --watch output showing colors on file locators and red squigglies, with a blue message before a diagnostic saying 'Found 2 errors in 2 files.'"
	description="Blue “message” message. Nowhere else does TypeScript use that. Odd."
	src={tscPrettyWatchBlueMessage}
/>

Elsewhere, such as with the nice "`Compilation complete. ...`" message, the `reportWatchDiagnostic` function not available in `emitFilesAndReportErrors` was used.
It was being created locally within `createWatchCompilerHost` but not passed through to (or visible within) `emitFilesAndReportErrors`.
I changed `emitFilesAndReportErrors` to take it as a parameter (in addition to `system.newLine` to pass to the `reporter`) and use it:

<LabeledImage
	alt="TypeScript --pretty --watch output showing a message with 'Found 2 errors in 2 files' formatted the same way as normal messages."
	description={'"Found 2 errors in 2 files."'}
	src={found2ErrorsIn2Files}
/>

Great that it printed!
But— that screenshot of just the two messages was everything.
Why no `"Starting compilation in watch mode..."`?

I went up the call chain for printing messages through `createWatchStatusReporter` and found a `clearScreenIfNotWatchingForFileChanges` function clearing the screen on printing each diagnostic message if the message isn't the specific "`Starting compilation in watch mode...`" one.
Spooky!
👻

I didn't understand why this function was made that way _(why not only clear the screen when starting a new compilation run?)_ and didn't feel comfortable changing it.
Spooky behavior like that felt best left alone and asked about in the pull request.
I added an array of allowed message codes to not clear on _(not TypeScript's `Map` shim because it only allows `string`s as keys)_.

<LabeledImage
	alt="TypeScript --pretty --watch output showing a message with 'Found 2 errors in 2 files' formatted the same way as normal messages. This time, there's a 'Starting compilation in watch mode...' beforehand."
	description="It lives! ...at the cost of some hardcoding."
	src={found2ErrorsIn2FilesStartingCompilation}
/>

## Step 3: Cleanup

emitFilesAndReportErrors was also being used by performCompilation in src/compiler/tsc.ts.
I discovered this when I tried to compile and it yelled at me.
That was a little surprising: why is the core tsc compiler using watch-specific logic?
More spookiness...
🤔

I couldn't pass the added reporter in from `performCompilation` because that's of type `WatchStatusReporter`, which is only available in the code that deals with watching logic.
That meant I would have to find a way to only report the new diagnostics in watch mode.
After hackily fumbling around with optional parameters for a while I ended up cutting & pasting `emitFilesAndReportErrors` up into three functions:

- `getProgramDiagnosticsAndEmit`: Retrieves diagnostics output and emit results from the program.
- `reportDiagnosticErrors`: Outputs the traditional error reporting that already existed.
- `summarizeDiagnosticsAcrossFiles`: Outputs the new summary message.

`tsc` calls the first two; `watch` calls all three.

## Step 4: Pull Request

Normally before sending out a PR I would write unit tests validating the change.
Always test your changes!
However, because I didn't understand the screen clearing behavior, I decided to put up what I had at this point for code review and ask there.

> [Added an errors summary for --pretty --watch results by JoshuaKGoldberg · Pull Request #22254](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/22254)

The first commit in that PR has everything I mentioned above: [e0d067b48f71e545c9bef49ad5fceb0a2a17a0ea](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/22254/commits/e0d067b48f71e545c9bef49ad5fceb0a2a17a0ea).

## Step 5: Feedback

Someone _asked me to change things_!
This didn't happen in the last contribution diary article's pull request…!
😥!

There were a few big pieces of initial feedback:

- Diagnostics aren't necessarily attached to files, so it would be inaccurate to report them as across files.
- Not all diagnostics are errors, so it would be inaccurate to count them all in the errors count.
- It would be cleaner to just add another optional parameter to `emitFilesAndReportErrors` that reports the error summary.

### 5.1: Removing File Counts

Not needing to report file counts actually made my change easier.
I removed the function that counted unique files with a Map.
It was a little upsetting at first to not have needed knowledge from the createMap investigation... but on the bright side, I now knew more about TypeScript's internals than I would have otherwise.
That's a good thing!
😇

### 5.2: Filtering Errors

I had to ask for confirmation on how to filter out non-error diagnostic messages.
The method was pretty simple:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```ts
diagnostics.filter(diagnostic.category === DiagnosticCategory.Error);
```

👉 _Protip: never be scared to ask for clarification on pull requests!_ 👈

### 5.3 Optional Error Summarizer

Specifically, the feedback was:

> I would rather modify the existing `emitFilesAndReportErrors` to take additional parameter to summaryReporter which could either be `undefined | reporter` and if provided you write the summary using that reporter.

An excuse to undo all the changes in `tsc.ts`!
Perfect.

### 5.4 Miscellaneous Feedback

There were a couple small points left, but nothing major. One was a preemptive bug fix (fixed 😌) and the other was a unit test comment (unable to do for a technical reason).

A merge from master, a couple of updates, and the PR was accepted!
🙌
