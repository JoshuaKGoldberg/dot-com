## Problem Statement

[TypeScript Issue 16152](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/16152) (following [Prettier Issue 1820](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/1820)): "trailing comma not allowed" error in type parameters.
When you have a list of type parameters split across lines, some code styles and formatters would prefer you have a "trailing" comma after the last one to maintain consistency:

```ts
export const myLambda = <
	TFirstTemplate,
	TSecondTemplate, // [ts] Error: Trailing comma not allowed.
>() => {
	/* ... */
};
```

That recently became a little more relevant because TypeScript added generic parameter defaults in addition to the existing extends clause.
These giant syntax lists can be pretty hard to read unless split across lines:

```ts
export const createSourceNodeFromTemplateBinding = <
	TTemplateBinding extends TemplateBinding = TemplateBinding,
	TSourceNode extends SourceNode = SourceNode, // comma here?
>(
	templateBinding: TTemplateBinding,
) => {
	/* ... */
};
```

Something in TypeScript was complaining about those trailing commas.

_Time to debug!_

## Step 1: Where

How does TypeScript create the complaint?

The complaint string was "`Trailing comma not allowed.`".
I ran a full text search on that string to see where it comes from.
There were a bunch of files, so I limited it to `.ts` files in the src directory.
Exactly one result: `src/compiler/diagnosticInformationMap.generated.ts`.
This file contains a giant key-value pair of lines with message-looking things.
Spacing the one I found out for readability:

```ts
Trailing_comma_not_allowed: diag(
    1009,
    DiagnosticCategory.Error,
    "Trailing_comma_not_allowed_1009",
    "Trailing comma not allowed."),
```

Using the context clues from the "diagnostic" word in the file's name and contents, this seems to be localized messages TypeScript can print out.
💯

Running a second full-text search on "`Trailing_comma_not_allowed`" found exactly one method: `checkGrammarForDisallowedTrailingComma`, in `src/compiler/checker.ts`.
From that name I was pretty sure this was what I needed.
I _also_ happened to remember reading in the (excellent) [Basarat Gitbook](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/docs/compiler/overview.html) how the "[Checker](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/compiler/checker.html)" in TypeScript is what validates types... and since this was in `checker.ts`, that felt good.

## Step 2: What?

What does TypeScript do to create the error?

I ran a third full-text search on `checkGrammarForDisallowedTrailingComma` and found 5 usages in `checker.ts`.
They were under these functions:

- `checkTupleType`
- **`checkGrammarTypeParameterList`**
- `checkGrammarTypeArguments`
- `checkGrammarHeritageClause`
- `checkGrammarVariableDeclarationList`

A diligent programmer intent on learning all there is to know about TypeScript might go read and understand each of these... but I could tell from the name that `checkGrammarTypeParameterList` was _probably_ what I needed.

```ts
function checkGrammarForDisallowedTrailingComma(
	list: NodeArray<Node>,
): boolean {
	if (list && list.hasTrailingComma) {
		const start = list.end - ",".length;
		const end = list.end;
		return grammarErrorAtPos(
			list[0],
			start,
			end - start,
			Diagnostics.Trailing_comma_not_allowed,
		);
	}
}
```

Without knowing much about node arrays, list types, or any of the surrounding code, it looks like this was checking if the list `hasTrailingComma` and adding a grammar error if so.
Exactly what I needed!
✔️

## Step 3: Fix

I removed calling `checkGrammarForDisallowedTrailingComma` from `checkGrammarTypeParameterList`, rebuilt the compiler (_[here's how to rebuild the compiler](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/250065e55b8f2bb212cb9d19b191cfeb15184ee0/CONTRIBUTING.md#helpful-tasks)_), and pointed my VS Code to my built TypeScript (_[here's how to use a local TypeScript in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling#_using-newer-typescript-versions)_).
It worked!
No IDE complaints for source files with trailing commas on type parameters!

At this point, I was _spooked_: surely there must have been much more to do.
TypeScript is huge!
There _must_ be overcomplicated cruft everywhere.

Turns out I was wrong: that was basically it.

## Step 4: Verify

TypeScript validates these checker behaviors with "baseline" tests.
Each test consists of a source file of TypeScript (or JavaScript) code under `tests/cases/**` and corresponding expected details under `baselines/reference/**`.
Manipulating them is documented in their [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/250065e55b8f2bb212cb9d19b191cfeb15184ee0/CONTRIBUTING.md#managing-the-baselines).

I compiled & ran tests to discover exactly one failure:

Test: `tests/cases/compiler/typeParameterListWithTrailingComma1.ts`

```ts
class C<T> {}
```

The test complaint was that there should have been an error in this, as per `tests/baselines/reference/typeParameterListWithTrailingComma1.errors.txt`.
After my change there was no longer an error.

💖 Perfect! 💖

I marked the baseline as accepted and the rest of the tests passed.

## Step 5: Pull Request

> [Allowed trailing commas in type parameter/argument lists by JoshuaKGoldberg · Pull Request #20599](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/20599):

> This change is only one source file and one error file... there must be something I'm missing!?
> Fixes #16152

At this point I was still pretty worried about the change being purely subtractive.
DanielRosenwasser (a core TypeScript team member) and vjeux (the top committer to Prettier) responded to my post with the 😄 emoji and my fears completely melted away.

Bonus points to vjeux and novjek for the 🎉 emoji.
If you maintain any size repository, let this be a lesson for you: emojis make first-time contributing much less scary.
Even though this wasn't my first TypeScript pull request, it was my first time changing the language itself (or anybody else's language), and I was feeling the imposter syndrome hard.
This might sound like a joke, but it isn't: humanizing the process made it feel like it was geared for outsiders like me and not just dedicated full-time paid closed-source maintainers.
Even the customary thanks from mhegazy (core TS team member who merged the PR) felt nice.
😄

I happened to send the pull request in the middle of December, so it wasn't until early January that it was merged in... but it got in without any complaints.

## Takeaways

1. Find-in-Files is the only IDE command you need.
1. TypeScript is just like any large code base: daunting if you let it, approachable if you try.
1. Code maintainers with senses of humor are best. 🌹
