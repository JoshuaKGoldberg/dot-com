2023 was my year of conferences.
I applied to a whole bunch, got into some, and had a fantastic year flying around the world every other week.
It was exhausting and I'm probably never going to go for that many again -- this year was an _experience_.

I want this page to serve as a collective of shout-outs to the great in-person conferences I attended this past year.
They're ordered by date.
Each has links to the conference as well as any associated repos, slides, videos.

I also included one treasured moment from each of them.
I probably could have gotten a few for each conference, but needed to keep it brief.

Thanks again to all the conference organizers for having me over.
You made my 2023 great.
💖

## [THAT Conf Texas 2023](https://thatconference.com/tx/2023)

> January 16 - Round Rock, USA
>
> Talk: Design Systems: Maximum Consistency, Minimum Effort
> [[Repo](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/design-system-sketch "THAT Conf Texas 2023 Repo")] [[Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvUc1cvPrJnWvtRv5w2TlFXfhHorNQ "THAT Conf Texas 2023 Slides")]

THAT Conf was my first conference of the year - and it was a grand one to start with.
The [THAT conference series](https://that.us) holds its conferences in Kalahari resorts.
They're a multi-day, multi-track event with a ton of different disciplines represented.

I met a bunch of the organizers the night before and helped out a bit with setting up the -impressively crafted!- stage scenery.
For such a large conference, it felt surprisingly personal.
You can tell Clark and the rest of the organizing team put a lot of care into it.

Treasured moment: hanging out with Akira, Brandon, Craigory, and other speakers around dinner and then at the piano cafe. 🎹

## StaffPlus NYC 2023

> March 16 - New York City, USA
>
> Talk: How to Complain Positively
> [[Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvUc1cvPrJnWvtxmfY5e0vvS62B62A "StaffPlus NYC 2023 Slides")] [[Video](https://leaddev.com/new-york/staffplus/video/2023/how-complain-positively "StaffPlus NYC 2023 Video")]

StaffPlus is part of the LeadDev family of conferences, targeted to developers in the "IC" (Individual Contributor) career path.
I appreciated having a conference for us.
The lineup of speakers around me was incredible.
I learned a whole bunch around both people-politics and tech-management that haven't come up in many other conferences.

This talk is also one of my favorite ones I've ever given.
It's a tight ten minutes that I'm really proud of the narrative flow and presentation style of.
I hope to give more talks in the coming year that flow the way this one does.

Treasured moment: having two consecutive "D 'n M" (Deep and Meaningful conversations) with Doug and Hila during the conference. 🥰

## React Miami 2023

> April 20 - Miami, USA
>
> Talk: Setting Up ESLint and TypeScript for React
> [[Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvUc1cvPrJnWvt0cjx-_PLIwDIzclw "React Miami 2023 Slides")] [[Video](https://www.youtube.com/live/mPPZ-NUnR-4?feature=share&t=25743 "React Miami 2023 Video")]

Miami!
Not very many conferences has quite so many people in my specific areas of web tooling.
Nor do many conferences have such a fun party vibe - while still being approachable.
The morning events (I chose the 5k), after-conference karaoke, and general fun vibes were thoroughly well organized.

React Miami also was notably great at including a diverse lineup that touched on more than just React.
It covered a gamut including accessibility, burnout, CSS, and the rest of the alphabet _(IYKYK)_.

Treasured moment: walking out on stage with a bunch of other speakers in oversided animal costumes for Kathleen's talk.
Or maybe, giggling about it backstage beforehand.

## Stir Trek 2023

> May 4 - Columbus, Ohio
>
> Talk: Building a Design System In-Flight
> [[Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvUc1cvPrJnWvtFnhBSaIhabdMf7oQ?e=0Me4QN "Stir Trek 2023 Slides")] [[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN6kOPUEicE "Stir Trek 2023 Video")]

Having a conference in a movie theater is a good idea.
Making the whole thing movie-themed and having a speaker event the night before of watching the new Guardians of the Galaxy, complete with popcorn, soda, and candy...
Awesome.

Treasured moment: grabbing dinner at a local BBQ place with Becca, Chris, Diana, Homer, Mark, and other speakers.

## CityJS Athens 2023

> May 29 - Athens, Greece
>
> Talk: TypeScript for JavaScripties
> [[Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvUc1cvPrJnWvt5Xbqy62vlssO23Ew "CityJS Athens 2023 Slides")] [[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxozlpc1hH8 "CityJS Athens 2023 Video")]

I'd heard of Greek hospitality before but this really showcased it.
The conference itself was very good (and in a cool ampitheater).
Plus I got to hang out with a couple local dev meetups.

But then we did a speaker day trip through Athens...
...and then Aris organized a lovely full-day trip with his family and other organizers on a beach.
Incredible.

Treasured moment: bonding with everyone over Greek food over lunch in a half-basement half-cafe.

## Web Directions Code 2023

> June 8 - Melbourne, Australia
>
> Talk: Static Analysis: Shockingly Useful! ⚡️
> [[Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvUc1cvPrJnWvt8B6-y28tCUw7Xqmg "Web Directions Code 2023 Slides")] [[Video](https://conffab.com/presentation/static-analysis-shockingly-useful-%e2%9a%a1%ef%b8%8f "Web Directions Code 2023 Video")]

Out of all the places I've been to, Australia has -by far- the best coffee.
No contest.
☕️

More importantly than supplying me with infinite cappuccinos, Web Directions Code also had an excellent spread of web technologies showcased by the speakers.
I learned a bunch about the web as a platform: bluetooth, passkeys, WebAssembly, and more.

I think
