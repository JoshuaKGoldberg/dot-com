2023 was my year of conferences.
I applied to a whole bunch, got into some, and had a fantastic year flying around the world every other week.
It was exhausting and I'm probably never going to go for that many again -- this year was an _experience_.

## Talk Reflections

I think 2023 is the year I really learned how to give a good tech talk.
Not all the talks I gave were good (especially as I got tired towards the end of the year), but there were a few that I'm truly proud of.
My 2024 talk goals will be around giving _great_ talks _reliably_.

### Favorite Talks

I liked quite a few of the talks I gave, but these ones were really my top ones.
The talks I try to give:

- Convey a well-defined scope of useful information along a narrative theme
- Guide the audience through a strong narrative backed up with good cheer and humor
- Provide actionable next steps for audience members to continue learning on their own

Some of my talks do that better than others.

#### How to Complain Positively

> [StaffPlus NYC 2023](#staffplus-nyc-2023)

This is one of my favorite talks ones I've given.
It's a tight ten minutes that walks through how I've messed up trying to effect positive change ("complain") in the past, better alternative strategies, and general tips for working with others.

I'm really proud of the flow and presentation style used.
I like how it uses emotion and humor to emphasize the points of the narrative.
I hope to give more talks in the coming year that flow the way this one does.

#### You Could Lint More

> [revo.js](#revojs-2023) and others

This talk is one of a family of talks I give under names like _"Static Analysis: Shockingly Awesome"_.
It covers what "static analysis" is, the difference between formatters, linters, and type checkers, and what type-checked linting with typescript-eslint entails.
The revo.js edition also added in a range of ESLint plugins that do assorted useful tasks.

I don't _love_ the way I presented this talk.
I think I needed to pause more as a presenter, and the narrative got a little boring towards the end.
But the contents make me happy and I believe have helped some folks get more out of their dev tooling.

### Talks to Work On

One annoying aspect of working in public is that people see you learning things the hard way.
Some folks will only ever see one talk of yours.
If that talk is one of the ones you're not proud of, that may form most or all of their opinion of you.
Irksome.

All speakers have to practice to get better -- and also need to pause and reflect between talks, get advice and feedback from peers, and study great speakers in the field.
I did a lot of the practice and less of the rest than I should have.

#### Real Time Nostalgia with Web Sockets

> [Wey Wey Web 2023](#wey-wey-web-2023)

I think this talk is going to be my [white whale](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/white_whale) of speaking.
It's meant to convey how waves of new tech abstractions and frameworks make it easier over time to make more and more complex apps -- against the backdrop of cool tech demos of real-time karaoke.
In theory the talk is really cool and packs an inspiring message about the past, present, and future of web dev.

In practice, each time I've given it I've been wholly unsatisfied with how it ties those themes in together.
I think it's too surface-level and doesn't tie in the themes together.
Attendees leave unsatisfied and wondering why I just threw a bunch of technical jargon at them.

One of these days I'm going to get that talk to work and it will be fantastic.
It didn't happen in 2022 or 2023 though.
😔

## The Conferences

I want this page to serve as a collective of shout-outs to the great in-person conferences I attended this past year.
They're ordered by date.
Each has links to the conference as well as any associated repos, slides, videos.

I also included one > treasured moment from each of them.
I probably could have gotten a few for each conference, but needed to keep it brief.

### [THAT Conf Texas 2023](https://thatconference.com/tx/2023)

> January 16 - Round Rock, USA
>
> Talk: Design Systems: Maximum Consistency, Minimum Effort
> [[Repo](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/design-system-sketch "THAT Conf Texas 2023 Repo")] [[Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvUc1cvPrJnWvtRv5w2TlFXfhHorNQ "THAT Conf Texas 2023 Slides")]

THAT Conf was my first conference of the year - and it was a grand one to start with.
The [THAT conference series](https://that.us) holds its conferences in Kalahari resorts.
They're a multi-day, multi-track event with a ton of different disciplines represented.

I met a bunch of the organizers the night before and helped out a bit with setting up the -impressively crafted!- stage scenery.
For such a large conference, it felt surprisingly personal.
You can tell Clark and the rest of the organizing team put a lot of care into it.

### [StaffPlus NYC 2023](https://leaddev.com/events/staffplus-new-york-2023)

> March 16 - New York City, USA
>
> Talk: How to Complain Positively
> [[Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvUc1cvPrJnWvtxmfY5e0vvS62B62A "StaffPlus NYC 2023 Slides")] [[Video](https://leaddev.com/new-york/staffplus/video/2023/how-complain-positively "StaffPlus NYC 2023 Video")]

StaffPlus is part of the LeadDev family of conferences, targeted to developers in the "IC" (Individual Contributor) career path.
I appreciated having a conference for us.
The lineup of speakers around me was incredible.
I learned a whole bunch around both people-politics and tech-management that haven't come up in many other conferences.

> Treasured moment: having two consecutive "D 'n M" (Deep and Meaningful conversations) with Doug and Hila during the conference. 🥰

### [React Miami 2023](https://www.reactmiami.com)

> April 20 - Miami, USA
>
> Talk: Setting Up ESLint and TypeScript for React
> [[Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvUc1cvPrJnWvt0cjx-_PLIwDIzclw "React Miami 2023 Slides")] [[Video](https://www.youtube.com/live/mPPZ-NUnR-4?feature=share&t=25743 "React Miami 2023 Video")]

Miami!
Not very many conferences has quite so many people in my specific areas of web tooling.
Nor do many conferences have such a fun party vibe - while still being approachable.
The morning events (I chose the 5k), after-conference karaoke, and general fun vibes were thoroughly well organized.

React Miami also was notably great at including a diverse lineup that touched on more than just React.
It covered a gamut including accessibility, burnout, CSS, and the rest of the alphabet _(IYKYK)_.

### [Stir Trek 2023](https://stirtrek.com)

> May 4 - Columbus, Ohio
>
> Talk: Building a Design System In-Flight
> [[Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvUc1cvPrJnWvtFnhBSaIhabdMf7oQ?e=0Me4QN "Stir Trek 2023 Slides")] [[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN6kOPUEicE "Stir Trek 2023 Video")]

Having a conference in a movie theater is a good idea.
Making the whole thing movie-themed and having a speaker event the night before of watching the new Guardians of the Galaxy, complete with popcorn, soda, and candy...
Awesome.

### [CityJS Athens 2023](https://greece.cityjsconf.org)

> May 29 - Athens, Greece
>
> Talk: TypeScript for JavaScripties
> [[Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvUc1cvPrJnWvt5Xbqy62vlssO23Ew "CityJS Athens 2023 Slides")] [[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxozlpc1hH8 "CityJS Athens 2023 Video")]

I'd heard of Greek hospitality before but this really showcased it.
The conference itself was very good (and in a cool ampitheater).
Plus I got to hang out with a couple local dev meetups.

But then we did a speaker day trip through Athens...
...and then Aris organized a lovely full-day trip with his family and other organizers on a beach.
Incredible.

> Treasured moment: bonding with everyone over Greek food over lunch in a half-basement half-cafe.

### [Web Directions Code 2023](https://webdirections.org/code)

> June 8 - Melbourne, Australia
>
> Talk: Static Analysis: Shockingly Useful! ⚡️
> [[Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvUc1cvPrJnWvt8B6-y28tCUw7Xqmg "Web Directions Code 2023 Slides")] [[Video](https://conffab.com/presentation/static-analysis-shockingly-useful-%e2%9a%a1%ef%b8%8f "Web Directions Code 2023 Video")]

Out of all the places I've been to, Australia has -by far- the best coffee.
No contest.
☕️

More importantly than supplying me with infinite cappuccinos, Web Directions Code also had an excellent spread of web technologies showcased by the speakers.
I learned a bunch about the web as a platform: bluetooth, passkeys, WebAssembly, and more.

I'll admit, this one was probably the most jetlagged I've ever been at a conference.
But it was worth it for the impromptu conversations in and out of the venue.

> Treasured moment: hanging out with the Allsop siblings at the organizers table between talks, chatting aimlessly about life and the industry.

### KCDC 2023

> June 21 & 22 - Kansas City, USA
>
> Talk: Static Analysis: Don't Fear the Linter
> [[Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvUc1cvPrJnWvt90PBRDuBcngQYCPg "KCDC 2023 Slides")]
>
> Talk: Floating and Sinking Promises: Understanding Broken Async Code
> [[Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvUc1cvPrJnWvt92381lRk5ZuHm2dw "KCDC 2023 Slides")] [[Repo](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/understanding-floating-and-sinking-promises "KCDC 2023 Repo")]

Along with THAT, KCDC holds a distinction of being one of the few "big" (>3 tracks + a convention hall) conferences I truly enjoy.
The talks were solid and staffed by a whole bunch of community folks I'd been wanting to spend more time around.

The sponsor booths were super well done too.
There was a sloth, an arcade cabinet, and a _puppy pit_ I got to lay around in.

> Treasured moment: having a deep and meaningful chat with Nick, then him kicking off a fantastic karaoke group with a soul-touching rendition of _It's Raining Men_ over Karaoke.

### [THAT Conf WI 2023](https://thatconference.com/wi/2023)

> July 23 - Wisconsin Dells, USA
>
> Talk: TypeScript for Javascripties: Day Camp Edition
> [[Slides](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AvUc1cvPrJnWvuEPyh8LP9z8JcM-xQ "THAT Conf WI 2023 Slides")]

My second THAT conference!
It was nifty seeing the bigger rendition of the same conference in a surprisingly similar Kalahari resort.
I was impressed with the consistency of the conferences.
The two had very similar vibes and style, with similarly high levels of quality.

The keynotes from the two conferences were universally high-impact and insightful.
I was happy to get the same kind of awesome community and talks the second time around.

## Final Thoughts

I love conferences.
They're a fantastic way to learn about new tech, connect with interesting people, and make friends in the industry.

I won't be doing as many in 2024 -- but that's only to be able to focus more and have more time for myself.

Thanks again to all the conference organizers for having me over.
You made my 2023 great.
💖
