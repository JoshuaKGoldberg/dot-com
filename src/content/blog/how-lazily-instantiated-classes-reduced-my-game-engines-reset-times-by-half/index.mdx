A very long time ago, I made the decision to write my own game engine from scratch.
If you want to get anything done well or in a reasonable amount of time it's a terrible idea, but it does serve as a great vehicle for exploring best practices in performance-critical code.

One area of interest is how to describe large numbers of in-game object classes.
I wanted to be able to add a class and its properties with as little code overhead as possible to avoid huge source files and maintenance difficulties.

My solution was a module called ObjectMakr that stores the inheritance tree for classes and descriptions of each of their properties as POJOs (_Plain Old JavaScript Objects_).
It then would create a class for each POJO description and extend as described in the inheritance tree.

## The Problem

Startup performance was _bad_ under this system.
Well over half of the reset time was spent in ObjectMakr's instantiation.
Using this screenshot of a captured performance profile, can you guess why?

<LabeledImage
	alt="Screenshot of a performance profile within a GameStartr class taking ~700ms. Most of the time is spent in FullScreenPokemon.resetModules, and within that ObjectMakr.processFunctions."
	description="Before: ~400ms creating dynamic classes; ~700ms reset time total"
	src={objectmakrBefore}
/>

In its original design, ObjectMakr processed _all_ class functions immediately.
That's the big green chunk in the center.
We're talking hundreds of dynamically generated `class` objects all being created and assigned properties before the game can do anything.
_Terrible!_

## The Change

Important performance protip: minimize unused work.
Out of those hundreds of objects, maybe a couple dozen would be used immediately.
I changed ObjectMakr to only instantiate classes as needed, and voila! Reset performance was suddenly much better.

<LabeledImage
	alt="Screenshot of a performance profile within a GameStartr class taking ~300ms. Now, time is split within resetModules between createModuleSettings, UserWrapper, and Gameplay.startOptions."
	description="After: ~1ms creating dynamic classes; ~300ms reset time total"
	src={objectmakrAfter}
/>

## Lessons Learned

### Use only what you need.

Laziness is good.
When designing startup flows, I like to think of each application component as a node in a directed acyclic graph ([DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)).
If you map out the components this way and do an exhaustive search starting from the “everything is ready!” state, you'll notice which parts are or aren't required to get there.

### Probably don't write your own game engine.

On the one hand, I've learned a _ton_ from it and have an intimate knowledge of all its ins and outs.
On the other hand, there are plenty of great open source alternatives for every popular platform yet I've sunk way too much time into this thing.
Were the learnings worth the time investment? Great question.

By the way, I have multiple game engine versions.
The title doesn't have a typo!
