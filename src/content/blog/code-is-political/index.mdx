title: "Yes, Code is Political"
---

Code is a product of the people and organizations that produce it.
Code, community, and politics are _intersectional_: they significantly influence each other bi-directionally.

I'm tired of people saying that code isn't political or that the stances of an organization or its leaders don't influence the quality and usability of its products.
They do.
Even if that downside isn't enough to change whether you should work with them, it's not something we can easily dismiss.

## Interlinked Expertise

In open source, most influential maintainers don't solely learn from docs sites, man pages, and source code.
They additionally do many or all of: following fellow maintainers on social media, watching talks, attending events, participating in online communities, and sometimes meeting personally.

Those forms of interaction all link the _personal_ and the _professional_.
It's exceedingly difficult to, say, only follow and support someone _professionally_, without also giving a boost to their _personal_ presence.

Let's suppose an important leader occasionally posts racist rhetoric, promotes ideologies that harm causes as trans rights, or posts support of authoritarian populists _(yes, these are all real examples)_.
Do you follow them to keep learning from their expertise, thereby validating their platform and amplifying _all_ of their posts?
Or do you separate from them, and lose out on learning from them?

Now consider an important community event that gives a speaking slot to that leader.
Now every attendee has to make that same choice: do they attend and support an event that platforms a person like that, or do they miss out?
If they're a member of a group targeted by that leader, would it even be safe for them to choose to stay in the first place?

If shared spaces such as in-person events and online groups don't create safe spaces then they directly exclude members of the community and force remainders to choose.
This is a sociopolitical action regardless of whether it was intended to be.

## Everything in Balance

Software projects of course can grow and flourish under leaders with regressive ideas and stances.
Nobody is perfect, and it is a shameful fallacy to assume that only progressively correct people have have good ideas.

Please don't take this post as judgement.
Everybody has a finite budget of "good" to do at the expense of their quality of life.
There is no black-and-white _"just do the right thing"_.

I still order from Amazon, use a Google smartphone, eat meat, etc.
I don't judge others for choosing different allocations of "good", or if they have different tolerances for giving niceties up.
Even learning and understanding the nuances of our actions' impacts is a long endeavor that not everyone has bandwidth for.

That being said, even if you don't have the ability to make a "right" choice, doesn't mean there aren't downsides to each choice.
Every tool we use, every platform we support, and every project we contribute to carries the imprint of the people and values behind it.

## This is Tiring

I didn't get into open source software to deal with politics on the internet.
I got here to write good code, learn from others, and contribute to the state of modern developer tooling.
Were it so easy.

After working in this space for a decade, I can't ignore how the actions of leaders and maintainers like myself directly impact the users of their products and tools.
Software is written by people, and the ways we set up people to work together have huge impacts on the software they produce.

We don't live in a vacuum.
Our choices ripple outward, especially in pursuits like software that are backed by scores of people.
Dismissing the politics of code isn't neutrality â€” it's complicity.
