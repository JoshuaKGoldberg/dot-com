## Problem Statement

[#50875: Spread operator results in incorrect types when used with tuples](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/50875) was filed on TypeScript in September of 2022.
It states that when trying to use a `...` spread operator on a tuple type (a type representing a fixed-size array), TypeScript slips up trying to understand what type the result would be.

That issue's original code is pretty gnarly and has a lot to read through.
By removing unnecessary code I was able to trim it down to three important lines of code:

```ts
function test<N extends number>(singletons: ["a"][], i: N) {
	const singleton = singletons[i];
	//    ^? ["a"][][N]

	const [, ...rest] = singleton;
	//          ^? Actual: "a"[]
	//           Expected: []
}
```

Here's a [TypeScript playground of the bug report](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?jsx=0&ts=4.9.4#code/GYVwdgxgLglg9mABFApgZygHgHKJQD1TABM1EwQBbAIxQCcA+ACjRjAHMAbFKBNALkQBtAOQBDEQF0hkgDSIYg7AEpEAbwBQiRBD5RErDt15IAvAbZcefITElbEAekfbtAPQD8Gh88QBVMAIABxRoFGIHXTAMYXkAOgS6dChJRHNDKxMfF1dc108NAF8gA).
Walking through the code:

- The type of `singletons` is an array of any size, where each element in the array is `["a"]`
  - It could be: `[ ["a"] ]`, or `[ ["a"], ["a"] ]`, or `[ ["a"], ["a"], ["a"] ]`, etc.
- The type of `singleton` should be `["a"]`: what you'd get by accessing any element `i` (`[N]`) under `singletons`'s type (`["a"][]`)
- The type of `rest` is what you get if you remove the first element from the tuple `["a"]`, which amounts to _no elements_ (`[]`)

...so if `rest` is supposed to be type `[]`, why is it somehow `"a"[]`?
Something was going wrong with TypeScript's type checker.

> Spoiler: here's the [resultant pull request](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/51037). ✨

### Playing with Type Parameters

Interestingly, if we change the `i` parameter's type from `N` to `number`, `rest`'s type is correctly inferred as `[]`:

```ts
function test(singletons: ["a"][], i: number) {
	const singleton = singletons[i];
	//    ^? ["a"]

	const [, ...rest] = singleton;
	//          ^? []
}
```

You can play with a [TypeScript playground of the working non-generic `number`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?jsx=0&ts=4.9.4#code/GYVwdgxgLglg9mABFApgZygCjTMBzAGxSgTQC5EBtAcgENqBdShgGkRgrBAFsAjFAE4BKRAG8AUIkQRSURDnxESSALzzchYqUowGkxAHoDUqQD0A-OP1HEAVTAoAHgAcU0FABN9MsBipsAOiCBdCgGRDUFTWVrYxN4kwtxAF8gA).

We can therefore deduce that the problem is from a generic type parameter being used to access an element in a tuple type.
Interesting.

### Playing with Rests

I also played around with the reproduction by removing the `...` rest from the type.
That got a type error to occur, as it should have:

```ts
function test<N extends number>(singletons: ["a"][], i: N) {
	const singleton = singletons[i];
	//    ^? ["a"][][N]

	const [, rest] = singleton;
	//       ~~~~
	// Tuple type '["a"]' of length '1' has no element at index '1'.
}
```

So TypeScript was still able to generally understand that `singleton`'s type is `["a"]`.
We can therefore further deduce that the problem is from a generic type parameter being used to access a `...` spread of rest elements in a tuple type.
Very interesting.

## Digging Into The Checker

At this point I wasn't sure where to go.
I'd never worked in the parts of TypeScript that deal with rests and spreads.
Nor had I dared try to touch code areas dealing with generic type parameters and type element accesses.

I did, however, know that `getTypeOfNode` is the function called when TypeScript tries to figure out the type at a location (it's the main function called by [`checker.getTypeAtLocation`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/96894db6cb5b7af6857b4d0c7f70f7d8ac782d51/src/compiler/checker.ts#L496)).
I put a breakpoint at the start of `getTypeNode`, then ran TypeScript in `node --inspect-brk` mode on the bug report's code in the VS Code debugger.
My goal was to try to find where TypeScript tries to understand the `[N]` access of the `["a"][]` type.

<details>
<summary>The call stack steps inside have a lot of nested function calls. If you have the time, I'd encourage you to pop TypeScript into your own VS Code debugger and follow along.</summary>

1. [`isDeclarationNameOrImportPropertyName`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/96894db6cb5b7af6857b4d0c7f70f7d8ac782d51/src/compiler/checker.ts#L43193) evaluates to `true`, so TypeScript calls to...
2. [`getTypeOfSymbol`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/96894db6cb5b7af6857b4d0c7f70f7d8ac782d51/src/compiler/checker.ts#L43196): `symbol.flags & (SymbolFlags.Variable | SymbolFlags.Property)` is true, so [`getTypeOfVariableOrParameterOrProperty`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/96894db6cb5b7af6857b4d0c7f70f7d8ac782d51/src/compiler/checker.ts#L9761) is called, which calls to...
3. [`getTypeOfVariableOrParameterOrPropertyWorker`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/96894db6cb5b7af6857b4d0c7f70f7d8ac782d51/src/compiler/checker.ts#L9775): `ts.isBindingElement(declaration)` is true, so TypeScript calls to...
4. [`getWidenedTypeForVariableLikeDeclaration`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/96894db6cb5b7af6857b4d0c7f70f7d8ac782d51/src/compiler/checker.ts#L9350): which calls to...
5. `getTypeForVariableLikeDeclaration`: `isBindingPattern(declaration.parent)` is `true`, so TypeScript calls to...
6. `getTypeForBindingElement`: `checkMode` is `CheckMode.RestBindingElement` and `parentType` does exist.
   - Calling `typeToString(parentType)` produces `'["a"][][N]'`.
   - Because `parentType` exists, TypeScript calls to...
7. `getBindingElementTypeFromParentType`: which seems to be the kind of _get an element based on the parent type_ code logic I'm looking for

</details>

I eventually stepped into the following block of code within `getBindingElementTypeFromParentType` function:

```ts
// If the parent is a tuple type, the rest element has a tuple type of the
// remaining tuple element types. Otherwise, the rest element has an array type with same
// element type as the parent type.
type = everyType(parentType, isTupleType)
	? mapType(parentType, (t) => sliceTupleType(t as TupleTypeReference, index))
	: createArrayType(elementType);
```

`everyType(parentType, isTupleType)` was evaluating to `false`.
Which feels wrong: the `parentType`, `["a"][][N]`, should be a tuple type!
Accessing any element of `["a"][]` should give back `["a"]`, a tuple of length 1.

### Resolving Base Constraints

At this point I think I understood the issue.
TypeScript was checking whether the `parentType` is a tuple type (or is a union of tuple types: hence the `everyType(...)`).
But since `parentType` referred to a _generic type parameter_, `isTupleType` was returning `false`.

What the code should have been doing was resolving the _base constraint_ of the parent type.
Knowing that the type parameter `N extends number` means that `["a"][][N]` should always result in an `["a"]` tuple.

I searched for `/base.*constraint/` to try to find how TypeScript code resolves base constraints.
A function named `getBaseConstraintOfType` showed up a bunch of times.
I changed the code to use `getBaseConstraintOfType(parentType)` for retrieving a parent type:

```ts
// If the parent is a tuple type, the rest element has a tuple type of the
// remaining tuple element types. Otherwise, the rest element has an array type with same
// element type as the parent type.
const baseConstraint = getBaseConstraintOrType(parentType);
type = everyType(baseConstraint, isTupleType)
	? mapType(baseConstraint, (t) =>
			sliceTupleType(t as TupleTypeReference, index)
	  )
	: createArrayType(elementType);
```

...and, voila!
Running the locally built TypeScript showed the original bug was fixed.
Nice!

## Adding Tests

I added the original bug report as a test case: ([`tests/cases/compiler/spreadTupleAccessedByTypeParameter.ts`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/TypeScript/blob/9066ba9cefd7b2a402de402006135295d8802d08/tests/cases/compiler/spreadTupleAccessedByTypeParameter.ts)).
Then upon running tests and accepting new baselines, I was surprised to see changes to the baseline for an existing test, [`tests/baselines/reference/narrowingDestructuring.types`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/TypeScript/blob/9066ba9cefd7b2a402de402006135295d8802d08/tests/baselines/reference/narrowingDestructuring.types):

{/* spell-checker: disable */}

```ts
function farr<T extends [number, string, string] | [string, number, number]>(
	x: T
) {
	const [head, ...tail] = x;
	if (x[0] === "number") {
		const [head, ...tail] = x;
	}
}
```

{/* spell-checker: enable */}

```diff
    const [head, ...tail] = x;
>head : string | number
- >tail : (string | number)[]
+ >tail : [string, string] | [number, number]
```

The updated baseline is more correct!
The type of `tail` (elements in `x` after `head`) indeed is `[string, string] | [number, number]`.
My change improved an existing test baseline!
Yay!
🥳

...and with tests working, I was able to send a pull request.

### Improving a Test

[@Andarist](https://github.com/Andarist) [commented on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/51037/files#r987365768 "Andarist comment on GitHub") that the test probably meant to check `typeof x[0] === "number"`, not just `x[0] === "number"`.
I ended up filing [#52410 narrowingDestructuring test missing a 'typeof' operator](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/52410) in writing this blog post.
