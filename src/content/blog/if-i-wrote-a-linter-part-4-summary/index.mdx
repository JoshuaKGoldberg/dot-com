Today's web linters are great.
[ESLint](https://eslint.org) is robust and has a huge ecosystem of plugins and configs.
Newer native speed linters such as [Biome](https://biomejs.dev), [`deno lint`](https://lint.deno.land), and [Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html) are fast and easy to set up with their own burgeoning ecosystems.

I've been working on TypeScript linting for almost a decade.
I started contributing to [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint) community projects in 2016 and am now a number of the [typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) and [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) teams.
Based on those years of various linters, I've collected a large set of design ideas that I want to try.

## High-Level Points

Those posts have a lot of ideas I'm excited about.
You can totally skim this list, it's huge!

- **[Part 1: Architecture](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture)**:
  - **[Hybrid core](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture#hybrid-core)**: native speed parsing for performance; TypeScript for approachable rules
  - **[TypeScript For Type Awareness](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture#typescript-for-type-awareness)**: directly using TypeScript for type aware rules
  - **[Type-Aware, Always](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture#type-aware-always)**: removing the need to delineate or configure type-awareness
  - **[Built-In TypeScript Support](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture#built-in-typescript-support)**: building TypeScript support in core, rather than as a plugin
  - **[Core Common Languages](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture#core-common-languages)**: additionally including universally relevant languages in core
  - **[Formatting Coordination](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture#formatting-coordination)**: saving users from having to configure a formatter separately
  - **[Embeddable by Design](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture#embeddable-by-design)**: to deduplicate running type checking in CI and locally
  - **[Rich Cross File Fixes](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture#rich-cross-file-fixes)**: for more powerful rule codemods
  - **[Cross File Caching](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture#cross-file-caching)**: to avoid re-running lint rules on unchanged files
  - **[Watch Mode](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture#watch-mode)**: for even faster local CLI dev loops
- **[Part 2: Developer Experience](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience)**:
  - **[Only Errors](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience#only-errors)**: eliminating complexity and confusion around warnings
  - **[Comprehensive Rule Reports](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience#comprehensive-rule-reports)**: enforcing friendly and informative messaging
  - **[Comprehensive Rule Documentation](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience#comprehensive-rule-documentation)**: similarly for documentation pages
  - **[Standardized Rule Metadata](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience#standardized-rule-metadata)**: for consistent names, descriptions, and other info
  - **[Typed Rules](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience#typed-rules)**: for TypeScript-level rule option help
  - **[Typed Plugin Settings](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience#typed-plugin-settings)**: so plugins can define and use them safely
  - **[Typed Configuration Files](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience#typed-configuration-files)**: helping users write config files with type safety
  - **[Inline Snapshot Unit Tests](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience#inline-snapshot-unit-tests)**: for rule tests that are easy to write and maintain
- **[Part 3: Ecosystem](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-3-ecosystem)**:
  - **[Community Discord](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-3-ecosystem#community-discord)**: aligning with the common community platform
  - **[Shared Glossary](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-3-ecosystem#shared-glossary)**: setting up consistent terminology across the ecosystem
  - **[Common Core Rules](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-3-ecosystem#common-core-rules)**: expanding core rules to cover ~universally useful cases
  - **[Community Organization](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-3-ecosystem#community-organization)**: assisting maintenance of high-priority rules
  - **[Plugin Registry](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-3-ecosystem#plugin-registry)**: centralizing a place to discover and register plugins
  - **[Config Initializer](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-3-ecosystem#config-initializer)**: using the registry for starter config generation
  - **[One-Way Compatibility](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-3-ecosystem#one-way-compatibility)**: porting existing use cases to the new architecture

Even if you just read those high-level points and/or don't work on linters yourself, I hope you're at least excited about the potential for a linter that embraces all those new strategies.
I think trying these ideas out will help take us to a much more pleasant and productive linting experience.

## Flint

Speaking of which -- I'm going to try these ideas out!
I'm finally writing my own TypeScript linter.
It's just a prototype for now, with two intended purposes:

- To try out these ideas and see how they work in practice
- To get me deep experience in writing a linter, so I can better contribute to real-world linters

The new linter branding is _**Flint**: A fast, friendly linter_ ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•.

Flint is extremely early stage at the moment.
I'm hoping to get a usable CLI prototype some time in summer 2025.
If you're interested in following along -or even better, helping out-, you can check out the [Flint Discord](https://discord.gg/rdC2XPCmn5) and [Flint GitHub repository](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/flint).

Please feel free to open issues or PRs.
Or just reach out to me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/joshuakgoldberg.com).
I would love to hear your thoughts on this post, linting in general, and the Flint project.

Thanks for reading!
