This was a long blog post series with a lot of details in each post.
These were the main points:

- [Part 1: Architecture](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture):
  - [Hybrid core](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture#hybrid-core): as described in [Hybrid Linters: The Best of Both Worlds](/blog/hybrid-linters-the-best-of-both-worlds)
  - [Type aware, always](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture#type-aware-always): with an architecture built for it along with [TypeScript's Go port](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port)
  - [Built-in TypeScript support](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture#built-in-typescript-support): no need for a separate parser or plugin
  - [TypeScript's AST](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture#typescripts-ast): no more TSESTree and dual-tree linting, just TypeScript's AST
  - [Embeddable by design](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-1-architecture#embeddable-by-design): native support for embedding within existing TypeScript services
- [Part 2: Developer Experience](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience):
  - [Formatting coordination](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience#formatting-coordination): so you don't have to separately configure a formatter
  - [Only errors](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience#only-errors): no more warnings clogging up projects over time, just errors
  - [Typed rules](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience#typed-rules): type-safe rule options and settings, even in your config files
  - [Typed plugin settings](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience#typed-plugin-settings): type-safe per-plugin settings
  - [Typed configuration files](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience#typed-configuration-files): type-safe config files with a clear, consistent API
  - [Native workspace support](/blog/if-i-wrote-a-linter-part-2-developer-experience#native-workspace-support): for monorepos that share parts of their configs across projects
- TODO: the rest

If you just read those high-level points, I hope you're at least excited about the potential for a linter that embraces all those new strategies.
And if you read the whole post, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
These are really exciting times for the JavaScript ecosystem, and I'm excited to see where it goes next.

## Flint

Anyway, I'm going to be prototyping a linter that does all those things over the next few months.
It's going to be called _**Flint**: A fast, friendly linter_ ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•.
Or something like that.

If you're interested in following along, you can check out the [Flint GitHub repository](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/flint).
If you want to help out, please feel free to open issues or PRs.
Or just reach out to me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/joshuakgoldberg.com).
I would love to hear your thoughts on this post and the project.

Thanks for reading!
