2023 was a fun year.
It was my second year as a full-time independent open source maintainer.
If 2022 was around trying new things, 2023 was around consolidating on where I can have a positive impact.

I like looking back at large time periods and the major events that happened during them.
It's useful to reflect back on what the most important happenings were, and to learn from any missed opportunities or mistakes.
Let's do that now for my 2023.

## Biggest Accomplishments

Out of all that happened in 2022, here's a list of my favorite highlights.

### Conference Speaking

Conferences -especially in-person ones- are great!
You get to attend talks by and chat with wonderful people from all over the industry.
I can't get enough of them.

2022 was the year I really went big on speaking at in-person conferences.
I talked in Berlin _(twice!)_, Brussels, Newquay, and Raleigh in the second half of the year.
And at each and every one of those conferences, I met people in person who I still have interactions with online months later.
Amazing.

Talking in-person at conferences is its own skill that I'm working on.
You can see me get more comfortable with enunciation, stage presence, and storytelling as the months went on.
I'm excited to keep getting better as a speaker - and hopefully keynote something in 2023.

> See my [How I Apply to Conferences](../how-i-apply-to-conferences) post for more information on talking at conferences.

### Living Wage in Open Source

Yup.
One of my biggest accomplishments in 2022 was New York City minimum wage.
For 2023, my equivalent accomplishment was [New York City living wage for an adult](https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/36061).
That's $25/hour, or about $4,000 a month / $48,000 a year (not including an additional ~$10-15k for health insurance).

My total income is about $5,000 a month / $60,000 a year.
That income is a combination of direct open source wages and side projects.

For context, I was earning more than three times that amount in base salary alone in industry.
Which is how I was able to build up savings to go full time open source in the first place.

All this should be taken with the same caveat from 2022 that my spouse is a Director of Agile Delivery with a real salary.
I'm not poor and am not complaining about my financial situation.
But!
You should absolutely still sponsor open source maintainers such as myself.
It lets us spend more time on the real open source projects or sponsoring newer maintainers, rather than asking for money.

#### Direct Open Source Income

My open source salary is about $2,860 a month / $34,300 a year:

- ~$2,300 a month from typescript-eslint's revenue: mostly via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/typescript-eslint), with additional bits from [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com) and [Thanks.dev](http://thanks.dev)
- ~$450 a month from [my personal GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/joshuakgoldberg)
- ~$110 a month from my non-typescript-eslint packages lifted by TideLift

That is a ~68% increase over the $1,700 a month / $20,400 a year open source income of 2022.

#### Side Project Income

Separately from my open source work, I earned about $2,150 a month / $25,700 from side projects:

- ~$1,300 a month on average from passive _Learning TypeScript_ royalties
- ~$7,100 total from consulting and other sponsored work, which I've since trimmed to zero
- ~$3,000 total from podcasts, which has replaced consulting for side income

That is a ~25% increase over the $1,725 a month / $20,700 a year side income of 2022.

### typescript-eslint

As with 2022, the biggest push I participated in was developer advocacy and software development for [typescript-eslint.io](https://typescript-eslint.io).
typescript-eslint is a crucial piece of the TypeScript ecosystem: it's what allows tools such as ESlint and Prettier to work with TypeScript.
Yet many TypeScript developers aren't familiar with typescript-eslint enough to use its recommended preset configurations.

My primary goals around typescript-eslint in 2022 were:

- Documentation: continuously adding to, reorganizing, and refining typescript-eslint.io.
- Organizational: documenting common contributing & maintenance tasks, and increasing funding sponsorships
- Paper cuts: fixing common user pains and longstanding bugs & feature requests
- v6: Releasing its beta in the spring and stable 6.0 over the summer

2023 was a great year for typescript-eslint.
I think v6 was a solid major version and I'm proud of what we released with it:

- Future-facing `stylistic` and `*-type-checked` configs
- Reworked default rule options to match many users' preferences
- Adjustments for a bunch of developer-facing paper cuts around AST oddities and some convenience APIs

Total monthly income for the project grew ~65% from an average of ~$2,800 / month for December 2022 to ~$4,600 a month for December 2023.
Plus I finally documented our maintenance practices and got the community Discord rolling.

## Missed Opportunities

As fun as 2022 was, I missed out on some key areas of growth.
Hindsight is 20/20 and I do wish I'd have had the time and focus to invest in these things more.

I hope I can grow in this area through 2023.

## Closing Thoughts

Open source is a gigantic playground that I've only barely started to explore.
2022 was a fun year that's positioned me to go deeper in 2023.
Look forward to lots more stuff from me in the coming months!
