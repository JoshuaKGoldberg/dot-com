2023 was a fun year.
It was my second year as a full-time independent open source maintainer.
If 2022 was around trying new things, 2023 was around consolidating on where I can have a positive impact.

I like looking back at large time periods and the major events that happened during them.
It's useful to reflect back on what the most important happenings were, and to learn from any missed opportunities or mistakes.
Let's do that now for my 2023.

## Biggest Accomplishments

Out of all that happened in 2022, here's a list of my favorite highlights.

### Conference Speaking

I'd thought 2022 was my big year of conferences, with a half dozen in-person ones.
Then in 2023 I _really_ went hard, averaging a conference every 2-3 weeks for most of the year.
My [2023 Conferences in Review](../2023-conferences-in-review) goes into them more.

I'm really proud of my conference-going in 2023.
I'm not a perfect conference-goer or conference-speaker, but I made great connections with people and became much more practiced as a presenter.

Networking and sharing information is also a huge boon for my role as an open source project maintainer.
Conferences allow me to learn how people use the projects I work on.
Which allows me to accordingly improve those projects, then give talks explaining those learnings.

> See my [How I Apply to Conferences](../how-i-apply-to-conferences) post for more information on talking at conferences.

### Living Wage in Open Source

Yup.
One of my biggest accomplishments in 2022 was New York City minimum wage.
For 2023, my equivalent accomplishment was [New York City living wage for an adult](https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/36061).
That's $25/hour, or about $4,000 a month / $48,000 a year (not including an additional ~$10-15k for health insurance).

My total income is about $5,000 a month / $60,000 a year.
That income is a combination of direct open source wages and side projects.

For context, I was earning more than three times that amount in base salary alone in industry.
Which is how I was able to build up savings to go full time open source in the first place.

All this should be taken with the same caveat from 2022 that my spouse is a Director of Agile Delivery with a real salary.
I'm not poor and am not complaining about my financial situation.
But!
You should absolutely still sponsor open source maintainers such as myself.
It lets us spend more time on the real open source projects or sponsoring newer maintainers, rather than asking for money.

#### Direct Open Source Income

My open source salary is about $2,860 a month / $34,300 a year:

- ~$2,300 a month from typescript-eslint's revenue: mostly via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/typescript-eslint), with additional bits from [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com) and [Thanks.dev](http://thanks.dev)
- ~$450 a month from [my personal GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/joshuakgoldberg)
- ~$110 a month from my non-typescript-eslint packages lifted by TideLift

That is a ~68% increase over the $1,700 a month / $20,400 a year open source income of 2022.

#### Side Project Income

Separately from my open source work, I earned about $2,150 a month / $25,700 from side projects:

- ~$1,300 a month on average from passive _Learning TypeScript_ royalties
- ~$7,100 total from consulting and other sponsored work, which I've since trimmed to zero
- ~$3,000 total from podcasts, which has replaced consulting for side income
- ~$200 total from Twitch

That is a ~25% increase over the $1,725 a month / $20,700 a year side income of 2022.

### typescript-eslint

As with 2022, the biggest push I participated in was developer advocacy and software development for [typescript-eslint.io](https://typescript-eslint.io).
typescript-eslint is a crucial piece of the TypeScript ecosystem: it's what allows tools such as ESlint and Prettier to work with TypeScript.
Yet many TypeScript developers aren't familiar with typescript-eslint enough to use its recommended preset configurations.

My primary goals around typescript-eslint in 2022 were:

- Documentation: continuously adding to, reorganizing, and refining typescript-eslint.io.
- Organizational: documenting common contributing & maintenance tasks, and increasing funding sponsorships
- Paper cuts: fixing common user pains and longstanding bugs & feature requests
- v6: Releasing its beta in the spring and stable 6.0 over the summer

2023 was a great year for typescript-eslint.
I think v6 was a solid major version and I'm proud of what we released with it:

- Future-facing `stylistic` and `*-type-checked` configs
- Reworked default rule options to match many users' preferences
- Adjustments for a bunch of developer-facing paper cuts around AST oddities and some convenience APIs

Total monthly income for the project grew ~65% from an average of ~$2,800 / month for December 2022 to ~$4,600 a month for December 2023.
Plus I finally documented our maintenance practices and got the community Discord rolling.

### create-typescript-app

I'd started a project called `template-typescript-node-package` back in 2022.
At first I was targeting it as a nice basis for my personal open source projects.
That's how I used it through the first half of 2023.

Through the second half of 2023, I [renamed it to `create-typescript-app`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app/issues/671) and generalized it so anybody can use it for TypeScript packages.
`npx create-typescript-app` can now be used to create a new repo or migrate an existing one to the template's tooling.
I [finished rolling it out to most of my other projects at the end of November](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app/issues/734).

Working consistently on `create-typescript-app` was an excellent choice for 2023.
It gave me opportunities to learn about, contribute to, and sometimes even create pieces of tooling that work together for as ideal a TypeScript repository as I can get to.
And now all my repositories adhere to my personal standards for how I think they should behave.

> See [Contributing to a create-typescript-app Repository](../contributing-to-a-create-typescript-app-repository) for a unified blog post walking through the tooling in those repositories.

### JoshuaKGoldberg (Dot Com)

I finally got around to consolidating my online blog and personal website into one website.
There are two relevant repositories:

- [`JoshuaKGoldberg/JoshuaKGoldberg`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/JoshuaKGoldberg): My GitHub README, plus a `joshuakgoldberg` npm package containing metadata on my projects.
  - I extracted out a [`github-sponsors-to-markdown`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/github-sponsors-to-markdown) package for creating a Markdown table summarizing GitHub sponsors.
- [`JoshuaKGoldberg/dot-com`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/dot-com): This Astro site, which uses the `joshuakgoldberg` npm package to build its _Projects_ page.
  - I extracted out an [`astro-plugin-konamimojisplosion`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/astro-plugin-konamimojisplosion) package for ... well, find out for yourself. ðŸ˜‰

### DefinitelyTyped: Offboarding TSLint and Onboarding dprint

I'd [helped maintain and then deprecate TSLint](../tslint-maintenance) back in the 2019 era.
But the gigantic [`DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) repository was still stuck on TSLint through 2023.
That repository has a large set of custom tooling -much of which is defined in [`Microsoft/DefinitelyTyped-tools`](https://github.com/Microsoft/DefinitelyTyped-tools) that needed to port from TSLint to ESLint.

Finishing the migration ended up requiring three main areas of work:

- Switching DefinitelyTyped's usage of formatting rules to a dedicated formatter
- Switching DefinitelyTyped's usage of non-formatting core and community TSLint rules to their ESLint equivalents
- Switching DefinitelyTyped's custom TSLint rules to custom ESLint rules

### Mocha

[Mocha](https://mochajs.org) is the JavaScript test framework I learned how to unit test with.
It fell out of maintenance for much of the last few years.
I'm now one of [three new Mocha maintainers](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/5027) as of November.
Which is super exciting for me and a great opportunity to help out the ecosystem.
I'm pumped!

### Other Open Source Projects

A big part of my `create-typescript-app` template work involved finding the right projects for different developer tooling needs.
Sometimes those projects didn't yet exist, or did exist and were no longer maintained.
Choice project highlights include:

- [`all-contributors-auto-action`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/all-contributors-auto-action) & [`all-contributors-for-repository`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/all-contributors-for-repository): Semi-automating [AllContributors](https://allcontributors.org) recognition based on GitHub commits, comments, issues, and pull requests
- [`are-docs-informative`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/are-docs-informative): Detects code comments that add no useful info. Now used in the [`jsdoc/informative-docs` ESLint rule](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/blob/main/docs/rules/informative-docs.md).
- [`dedent`](https://github.com/dmnd/dedent): I took over project maintenance and refreshed the repository on GitHub. The project is pretty stable so I'm happy to not make any ground-breaking changes.
- [`eslint-plugin-expect-type`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/eslint-plugin-expect-type): I took over project maintenance, refreshed the repository on GitHub, and set in motion plans to use it in DefinitelyTyped soon.
- [`eslint-plugin-package-json`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/eslint-plugin-package-json): I took over project maintenance, refreshed the repository on GitHub, worked with contributors to add a host of new rules, and added a big tracking issue to bring in all sorts of new features.
- [`node-emoji`](https://github.com/omnidan/node-emoji): I joined as a maintainer, refreshed the repository on GitHub, and helped plan for the next major version.
- [`prettier-plugin-curly`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/prettier-plugin-curly): A Prettier plugin that enforces using `{}`s around blocks.

I'm also particularly excited about a few projects unrelated to `create-typescript-app`:

- [`ts-api-utils`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/ts-api-utils): Replaces the unmaintained `tsutils` as a standard set of utility functions for TypeScript's API.
- [`tidelift-me-up`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/tidelift-me-up) & [`tidelift-me-up-site`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/tidelift-me-up-site): Finds npm packages eligible for Tidelift funding.

The full list of projects I work on -including ones I created and ones I joined- is on [joshuakgoldberg.com/projects](https://joshuakgoldberg.com/projects), under _All_.

## Missed Opportunities

As fun as 2022 was, I missed out on some key areas of growth.
Hindsight is 20/20 and I do wish I'd have had the time and focus to invest in these things more.

I hope I can grow in this area through 2023.

## Closing Thoughts

Open source is a gigantic playground that I've only barely started to explore.
2022 was a fun year that's positioned me to go deeper in 2023.
Look forward to lots more stuff from me in the coming months!
