I've been proclaiming loudly for several years now to [_"STOP USING ESLINT FOR FORMATTING"_](/blog/configuring-eslint-prettier-and-typescript-together#stop-using-eslint-for-formatting).
My belief is that _formatters_ such as [Prettier](https://prettier.io) and _linters_ such as [ESLint](https://eslint.org) are fundamentally different tools built for different purposes.
While you can use ESLint for formatting thanks to [ESLint Stylistic](https://eslint.style), [ESLint recommends using a separate dedicated formatter](https://eslint.org/blog/2023/10/deprecating-formatting-rules) and [typescript-eslint also recommends against using ESLint for formatting](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/troubleshooting/formatting).

The following two tools have historically been used to help ESLint interact nicely with Prettier:

- [`eslint-config-prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier): An ESLint _shareable config_ that disables formatting-related rules
- [`eslint-plugin-prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier): An ESLint _plugin_ that runs Prettier as a rule inside ESLint

I believe neither tool is useful in most projects anymore.
This blog post will explain the purpose of each of them, their differences, and why I generally don't use either.

## Recap: ESLint Customizations

[ESLint](https://eslint.org) works by letting individually configure "rules", or checks on your codebase.
ESLint will do the work of parsing your code into a format rules understand, passing the code to those rules, and letting you know about any reports emitted by those rules.

ESLint is highly extensible: meaning you can customize many aspects of how it runs.
The most common ways to customize it are:

- **[Parsers](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/ways-to-extend#custom-parsers)**: Replace ESLint's built-in JavaScript parser to support reading code with different syntax than native JavaScript
- **[Plugins](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/ways-to-extend#plugins)**: Provide a set of rules that are added to the list of rules available to be configured
- **[Shareable Configs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/ways-to-extend#shareable-configs)**: Provide configuration options for any number of rules - either as a standalone npm package or from part of a _plugin_

Note that _plugins_ and _shareable configs_ are two different things.

- _**Plugins**_ make rules available without configuring those rules.
- _**Shareable configs**_ configure rules that come with ESLint and/or were previously made available in plugins.

### ESLint Customization Example: TypeScript

If you use ESLint to lint TypeScript code then you're hopefully using all three customizations:

- **Parser**: [`@typescript-eslint/parser`](https://typescript-eslint.io/packages/parser) to support parsing TypeScript code
- **Plugin**: [`@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`](https://typescript-eslint.io/packages/eslint-plugin) to load in rules specific to TypeScript
- **Shareable Config(s)**: Shared settings packaged with `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` that configure many rules at once, such as [`plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended`](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/configs#recommended).

Note that the typescript-eslint _shareable configs_ come from the `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` npm package.
Hence the `plugin:` prefix in front of them: that's how ESLint knows where to find the configs.

## `eslint-config-prettier`

[`eslint-config-prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) is a _shareable config_ that disables formatting-related rules.
You can load it into your project by listing it under `"extends"` array in your ESLint config:

```json
{
	"extends": [
		// (shorthand for "eslint-config-prettier")
		"prettier"
	]
}
```

The sole purpose of `eslint-config-prettier` is to turn rules off.
On the inside, it looks like an object with a bunch of properties whose values are `0` or `"off"`.
Roughly:

```json
{
	"curly": "off",
	"no-unexpected-multiline": "off",
	"@babel/object-curly-spacing": "off",
	"@typescript-eslint/lines-around-comment": "off"
}
```

### Why `eslint-config-prettier` Came To Be

Back in the day, popular shareable configs such as [`eslint-config-airbnb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) were often used to enable many rules at once.
These configs were popular because they established a well-known, opinionated style guide and set of logical checks on code.
Their downside was that they were oftentimes too opinionated - even enabling formatting rules.

Developers got around those formatting rules by knowing that ESLint evaluates configs in the order they're listed under `"extends"`.
`eslint-config-prettier` could be placed last in a project's ESLint config to turn off any formatting rules enabled by previous plugins.

```json
{
	"extends": [
		// 1. Configures many ESLint rules, including enabling some formatting ones
		"airbnb",
		// 2. Disables only the formatting rules from previous configs
		"prettier"
	]
}
```

By extending from `eslint-config-prettier` last, projects could gain the benefits of those popular shareable configs without having to run formatting rules within ESLint.

### Why `eslint-config-prettier` Is Often Unnecessary

Over the last few years, ESLint best practices have advanced in two ways (among others):

- ESLint core and most community plugins have determined that enabling overly opinionated rules -especially stylistic ones- in shareable configs makes developers dislike ESLint without much real benefit
- The recommended rulesets in ESLint and typescript-eslint have grown to include most of the beneficial logical rules that shareable configs such as `eslint-config-airbnb` were largely used for

As a result, many new projects haven't felt a need to load in opinionated configs such as `eslint-config-airbnb`.
Many projects start out with a much more straightforward set of configs:

1. To start: `"eslint:recommended"`, ESLint's built-in recommended configuration
2. If using TypeScript: `"plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"` or `"plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked"` for the recommended TypeScript rules
3. Any framework- or library-specific plugins, such as [`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y)'s `"plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended"`

**If you don't use a legacy ESLint shareable config that enables formatting rules, you probably don't need `eslint-config-prettier`.**
Adding `eslint-config-prettier` at the end of the `"extends"` list doesn't do anything if nothing enabled formatting rules to begin with.
Therefore, most projects don't gain any benefit from `eslint-config-prettier`.

Furthermore, two insidious points of confusion can arise from using `eslint-config-prettier` redundantly:

- Seeing a reference to _"prettier"_ in an ESLint configuration can confuse developers new to the area.
- Nothing stops projects from manually re-enabling formatting rules under the ESLint configuration's `"overrides"` or `"rules"` properties.

I now recommend against including `eslint-config-prettier` in most new projects.

> 💡 Not sure whether you can safely remove `"prettier"` from your `"extends"`?
> Try removing it, then running `npx eslint-config-prettier some/file.js` to see if it points out any conflicting rules.
> Running ESLint with [`--print-config`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/command-line-interface#--print-config) can alternately print out the full list of lint rule configurations for a file.

## `eslint-plugin-prettier`

`eslint-plugin-prettier` is an ESLint _plugin_ that provides two things:

- A custom rule, `prettier/prettier`, that runs all of Prettier inside a single ESLint rule
- A shareable config, `plugin:prettier/recommended`, that enables the `prettier/prettier` rule

For example, in ESLint's legacy config format, you might enable it by extending its recommended config:

```json
{
	"extends": ["plugin:prettier/recommended"]
}
```

Extending that config:

1. Adds `eslint-plugin-prettier` to the `"plugins"` list of extended plugins, thereby loading in the `prettier/prettier` rule
2. Enables the `prettier/prettier` rule
3. Adds `eslint-config-prettier` to the `"extends"` list of extended configs

The advantage of this approach is that you don't need to separately configure Prettier alongside ESLint.
You can have one file -your ESLint config- that enables both.

### Why `eslint-plugin-prettier` Is Often Harmful

There are two big problems with running Prettier inside an ESLint rule the way `eslint-plugin-prettier` does:

- Behavioral: it joins Prettier's reports with ESLint's, which in my experience confuses developers who aren't familiar with the tools
- Performance: formatting is now blocked on all linting, which is often much slower than formatting

The performance point can become quite bad in projects that utilize [type-checked rules](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/typed-linting).

- If `prettier/prettier` is the only lint rule that produces reports containing an auto-fixer, linting has to run twice
- If any other rules introduce auto-fixes, one or more additional cycles may be introduced from `prettier/prettier` fixing formatting issues with those auto-fixes

> 😬 Keep in mind that lint rules don't have visibility into formatting settings.
> Their auto-fixers aren't likely to produce code that aligns to your formatter.

Type-checked linting is by nature generally at least as slow as running the TypeScript type checker on all linted files.
[Rust-Based JavaScript Linters: Fast, But No Typed Linting Right Now](/blog/rust-based-javascript-linters-fast-but-no-typed-linting-right-now) explains why.
Running linting additional extra times adds up - and contributes to false negative perceptions around ESLint's and typescript-eslint's performance.

**I strongly recommend you do not use `eslint-plugin-prettier`**.
We even explicitly recommend against `eslint-plugin-prettier` in the [typescript-eslint formatting FAQs](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/troubleshooting/formatting#eslint-plugin-prettier) and [typescript-eslint performance troubleshooting docs](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/troubleshooting/performance-troubleshooting#eslint-plugin-prettier).

If `prettier/prettier` is enabled in your ESLint configuration, the best step you can take is to remove it and uninstall the `eslint-plugin-prettier` package altogether.
Failing that, you can disable the rule manually (`"prettier/prettier": "off"` under `"rules"`).
At that point you'll still have the `eslint-config-prettier` shareable config enabled.

## In Conclusion

_Formatting_ and _linting_ are two separate concerns.
Mixing the two can have negative impacts on the performance and understandability of your developer tooling.
My standard repository template, [`create-typescript-app`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app), keeps the two explicitly separate.

If your ESLint configuration references [`eslint-config-prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier), I suggest you try to remove it from your config.
You probably don't need it anymore.

If your ESLint configuration references [`eslint-plugin-prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier), I strongly recommend you instead enable Prettier separately from ESLint.
Running the `prettier/prettier` rule can introduce significant performance pain to your project.

No matter what tooling your ESLint configuration enables, if you haven't overhauled it in a few years, I strongly recommend:

1. Making sure `"eslint:recommended"` is in your rule extensions
2. If you're using TypeScript:
   1. Making sure at least [`plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended`](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/configs#recommended) is enabled - or even better, [`plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked`](https://typescript-eslint.io/linting/configs#recommended-type-checked)
   2. Checking the [`.eslintrc.cjs` from `create-typescript-app`](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/create-typescript-app/blob/main/.eslintrc.cjs), for any rules or plugins generally applicable to your project
3. Checking [github.com/dustinspecker/awesome-eslint](https://github.com/dustinspecker/awesome-eslint) for any additional plugins relevant to your project

Happy linting, everyone! 🎉

Much appreciation to [Anisha Malde](https://www.anisha.dev) for suggesting I write an explainer in this area and helping ideate contents.
Thanks!
🙌

Thanks to [Ben Scott](https://github.com/BPScott), a maintainer of `eslint-config-prettier`, for reviewing the post and suggesting clarifications and corrections on how `eslint-plugin-prettier` is described.

Thanks to [Simon Lydell](https://github.com/lydell), the original creator and a long-time maintainer of `eslint-config-prettier`, for reviewing the post and suggesting the `npx eslint-config-prettier` approach.

We should also note that although I personally disagree with using `eslint-config-prettier` and `eslint-plugin-prettier` _now_, they have been legitimately useful tools for many years.
I like to think that they've helped many folks onboard to formatting and/or linting their code.
Heck, I'd still rather work in a project that uses them than a project that doesn't auto-format at all!
Many thanks to all their contributors and maintainers over the years!
❤️
