I'm the founder of [Boston TS Club](https://bostontypescriptclub.com), a meetup for TypeScript developers in the Boston area.
Someone asked me last week how much effort it takes to start a local developer meetup like Boston TS Club.
Several hundred words of emotional venting later, I realized I'd written a mini-guide.

It's a great question to ask: local meetups are a great way to build community, and they can be a lot of fun!
But they take a lot of energy and time -- both to get started and to keep going.

If you want to start a meetup, lovely!
You should know what you're getting into.
This post is a summary of the steps I went through to learn organizing, start a meetup, and keep it running.

## Pre-Work

I strongly recommend you ease your way into meetup organizing.
Don't just jump in without experience: you'll be overwhelmed and not know all the common mistakes to avoid.

1. Start by attending a few local meetups.
   Get a feel for how they work, what attributes of meetups you like or don't like, and any particularly excellent attributes you'd want to replicate.
2. After you've been to at least a few meetings, volunteer to help out at one or two of those local meetups.
   This could be anything from setting up chairs to helping with social media.
   You'll get a feel for the work involved and how the organizers operate.
3. After you've volunteered for a while, talk to the organizers to see if you can take on a larger role.
   As in, rather than just doing tasks others assign to you, see if you can start taking on some of the planning and consequent responsibility.

Ideally, I would also recommend speaking at those local meetups.
You don't have to be a speaker to be an organizer, but it seriously helps you understand the speaker experience.
Many of the skills used in speaking are also used in organizing: in particular building empathy for others and understanding how to communicate with them.

Once you've done all that, you should have a good feel for how local meetups work.
You should in particular look out for how much work they are, how much you enjoy doing that work, and how much emotional toil they entail.
Do you want to start doing that?
Do you think you can keep doing it for months?
...years?

If so, then you are a rare and wonderful person.
Please read on.

## Ideation

The first concrete actions in making a meetup are either or both of:

- Determining which topic areas you want the meetup to cover
- Finding people you want to start the meetup with

TODO mention either/or order is fine

### Co-Founders

### Topic Areas

## Event Style

- Frequency
- Duration
- Location
- Size
- Format

TODO: recording?
Not every meetup records their events.
Keeping an event offline can make it easier to get first-time speakers, since they don't have to worry about mistakes being seen later.
But we prefer TODO etc. etc.

### Design

Your meetup needs a visual identity!
That includes:

- Color: the palette used in your merchandise, social media, and website.
- Logo: something you can put on laptop stickers, t-shirts, and as profile photos on social media.
- Vibes: some mixture of phrasing and typography.
  What impression do you want to give off?

Once you have your visual identity, you'll need to use it for:

- Merchandise: stickers, t-shirts, and other swag items
- Social media: creating templates for medias to attach to posts, as well as how to phrase the posts themselves
- Website: to store your events list, code of conduct, and general information

I strongly recommend you get a designer to help with this.
Ideally a designer who is on your organizer team.
It's easy for a non-designer like me to do a mediocre job given a lot of hours of work.
But having an actual design-savvy person makes a huge, noticeable difference.

### Merchandise

Branded laptop stickers, t-shirts, and other swag items are great ways to advertise the meetup and make attendees feel like they're part of a real community.
I strongly recommend you at least make stickers to pass out for free.
Then also get t-shirts to sell to attendees.

Some meetups try to work with local printers on merchandise.
Supporting local businesses is great!
I don't know which vendors are good for this in Boston, though.

For stickers, we've found [StickerApp](https://stickerapp.com) to have great quality and reasonable prices.
We send [this $100 order for about 450 stickers](https://stickerapp.com/customer/order/2925670/0febaa856d6979) roughly once a year.

For shirts, we go through [shop.squiggle.tools](https://shop.squiggle.tools).
It's a joint shop with [SquiggleConf](https://squiggleconf.com), built with:

    - [Shopify](https://shopify.com) to serve the website and manage inventory
    - [Printful](https://printful.com): to print and ship shirts and other items on demand ("drop shipping")

The [Bella + Canvas 3001 t-shirt](https://www.printful.com/custom/mens/t-shirts/unisex-staple-t-shirt-bella-canvas-3001) is a great comfortable option.
It's about $19 per shirt to include a design on the back.
We sell them for $20 each, not including shipping costs.

### Organization

How do you want to organize the meetup?

TODO: mention governance

TODO: mention nonprofit (tax discounts!)

## Runtime

Once you've started the meetup, you'll need to keep it running.
Most meetups end up getting into a predictable cycle of work that happens on a cadence.
For example, if you're running a monthly meetup, that might be the 2-3 months of work that it takes to organize each edition.

At a very high level, each meetup goes through:

1. Date selection: choosing a primary date and a backup date
2. Venue confirmation: making sure the venue has confirmed your booking
3. Speaker outreach: getting people to speak at the meetup
4. Advertising: posting on your event platform(s) and social media
5. Event day: setting up, running, and then cleaning up after the event
6. Post-event: editing and posting videos

Here's a more granular description all the areas of responsibility work we have in Boston TS Club for each meetup.

### A/V

We record each meetup and post the videos online.
That means we need at least one stable camera pointing at the speaker at all times, and at least one microphone listening to them.

The barest meetup could get away with a single smartphone on a stand, but that generally results in a somewhat low quality recording.
We go for a higher grade setup:

- _(TODO insert classification of microphone)_ _(TODO insert placement of microphone)_
- _(TODO insert classification of camera)_ operated by an organizer to follow the speaker
- Recorded files are transferred to _(TODO insert storage style)_

Editing the videos is a separate task.
Our first video took _(TODO insert time)_ to edit, most of which was one-time setup work for the video template.
They now take about _(TODO insert time)_ each.

### Catering

If an event last multiple hours, people will generally expect food.
Especially if it's in the common post-work time slot.

Some meetups provide pizza and soda.
That's a good start: reliable, easy to work with, and relatively inexpensive.
Assuming Boston's common pizza pricing of around $12-15 per large pizza, at 1 pizza per 3 people that's about $4-5 a person.

I don't like meetup pizzas.
I've had way too many of them, they're unhealthy, and they're hard for gluten-free or vegetarian diets.
A more varied menu such as a burrito/taco bar or sandwiches is theoretically better in my opinion -- but raises the price to around $8-10 a person.

For Boston TS Club, we have a private vegan caterer -[@plantiful.cooking](https://www.instagram.com/plantiful.cooking)- who does a great job.
Caterers like Savannah are generally more expensive than the burrito bar, but in my experience are much better.
Savannah does a great job with the food, provides a fun set of different choices each month, and is much more pleasant to work with.
If you have the extra budget per meetup, I'd highly recommend a local independent caterer.

### Help Desk

Attendees need a place to check in when they arrive.
They also need a place to come to with questions.
Organizers need a place to present branded posters and any merchandise.
This typically all happens in a table placed near the entrance to the venue.

Attendees of Boston TS Club have to pass by the help desk to get into the main room.
That's where we have them fill out a name badge, confirm they know they can find information on our website, and receive branded stickers.

We keep at least one organizer at the help desk starting before the meetup and through the initial 30-60 minutes of networking time.
We also try to have an organizer near the help desk throughout the meetup.

#### Merchandise Sales

In Boston TS Club we order a few [20% discounted Printful sample orders](https://help.printful.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014067959-How-do-sample-orders-work) of t-shirts each month.
Those shirts are then shown and sold at our help desk.
We've found attendees are more likely to buy apparel in-person than online.
But, that brings up a challenge: how do you accept payment?

At first, we accepted cash or allowed personal payments on platforms organizers happened to personally be on such as Venmo and Zelle.
That was straightforward for attendees to work with but didn't look very professional.
Plus, now that we're a 501(c)(3) non-profit, we need to keep track of our income more formally.

Nowadays we use a [$250 Square Terminal](https://squareup.com/shop/hardware/us/en/products/terminal-credit-card-machine) to accept credit card and tap-to-pay payments.
It cost more to order but integrates nicely with our backing financial management platforms.
A cheaper alternative if you're also already on Shopify could be the [$50 Shopify Tap & Chip Card Reader](https://hardware.shopify.com/products/shopify-tap-chip-card-reader).
I'm told other hardware alternatives work well too, but haven't tried them myself.

### Master of Ceremonies

The Master of Ceremonies, or M.C. ("emcee"), is the face of the meetup.
They:

- Announce the start of the meetup
- Explain standard starting information such as the code of conduct
- Introduce each speaker
- Announce the end of the meetup
- Thank the speakers and attendees for coming

We also keep a template of slides for the M.C. to use at the beginning of each meetup.
The M.C. will review those slides and make adjustments for any event-specific announcements before starting each meetup.

The M.C. role requires someone who is not just comfortable speaking to a crowd, but can also command the audience.
That can be a hard skill to find and build.
We rotate this role through the organizers to give everyone a chance to practice.

### Social Media

A.B.A.: Always Be Advertising!
You need to continuously post on social media to keep your meetup discoverable for prospective attendees.

For each meetup, we try to post:

1. At least a few weeks ahead of time to announce it:
   1. One starting post to announce the meetup
   2. Individual posts for each speaker
2. A week before the meetup to remind people
3. The day of the meetup to again remind people
4. The day after the meetup to thank attendees, speakers, and sponsors
5. Once the videos are posted online

In Boston TS Club, we post to all of: Bluesky, Mastodon, LinkedIn, and X [^x].
We keep an image template for the announcement posts.
The posting work is largely copy & paste, with some new phrases used to liven up the messages each month.

### Speaker Outreach

I have found finding speakers to be the hardest part of running a meetup.
I've heard from other organizers that it's easier if you live in a big tech city like San Francisco and have a meetup tailored to a hyped technology like AI.
If you don't have that advantage, it's very likely your public speaking form will receive roughly zero submissions in most months.

We source a lot of our speakers from repeat attendees.
Meaning: we pester them _(very amicably, of course!)_ until they agree to speak _(or say they don't want to)_.
But that's not enough to source speakers month after month.

Most meetups also have to find speakers by reaching out online.
Finding speakers online involves:

1. Looking around on social media and at other meetups to find people who might be willing to speak
2. Reaching out to them with a friendly invite to at least attend the meetup
3. Getting ghosted or rejected almost all of the time

Having an organizer with a positive personal brand in tech the way I do is very helpful.
But even then, I still get ghosted or rejected most of the time.

#### Speaker Diversity

I am not a DEI expert, but I do believe a diverse speaker lineup is beneficial and important to strive for.
It helps show that the community is open to all, helps attendees see themselves in the community, and gives speaking time to folks who traditionally might not have had it.

Finding any speakers is hard.
Finding a group of speakers represents a large swathe of the community is even harder.
Meetups in areas with a less diverse community have that much harder of a challenge.

I consider myself fortunate to be in an area with a large, diverse tech community.
Speaking in terms of how speakers self-disclose and present, Boston TS Club averages approximately one woman speaking per meetup.
We also have had at least one speaker who is not a white man at all but one meetup each year.
I hope that that has, at the very least, not perpetuated existing under-representation in the community.

### Sponsorships

Meetups cost money.
Even if your venue is free the way Boston TS Club's is, you still need to pay for food, merchandise, and any online services.
Boston TS Club's current per-meetup cost is about ~$400 a meetup.

Most meetups are possible due to:

1. At first, personal money spent by a founder
2. Once they're more established, sponsorships from local companies

In order to get sponsorships, you need to convince companies that their money and time is well-spent on your meetup.
That often comes in the form of a "sponsorship prospectus" document.
A sponsorship prospectus is a shareable document that typically includes:

- A high-level description of the meetup
- Examples of past speakers and/or positive feedback from attendees
- The benefits of sponsoring: demoing products, distributing swag, supporting the community,
- How much different tiers of sponsorship cost

I strongly recommend you actively work on sponsorships.
Promote them during the meetup and on social media.
Reach out to companies you think would be interested, especially those you have contacts at.

Sponsorships can take a while to get going.
Much like speaker outreach, you will be ghosted or rejected most of the time.

But, getting great sponsors makes a huge positive difference in the meetup.
They do more than pay the bills.
They make you look more official and can be a fantastic source of talks.

### Venue

Finding good a place to regularly meet can be difficult.
Plenty of bars, restaurants, and other general event spaces can be rented for a price -- but that can get expensive.
Most sustained tech meetups I've been to end up getting hosted for free at a tech company's office or at a discount in a local maker space.

A good venue:

- Is located close to public transportation
- Has a large enough sitting space for attendees to sit and watch speakers
- Has a large enough standing space for attendees to mingle and network
- Has a good A/V setup for recording and streaming

Boston TS Club is incredibly fortunate to be hosted for free by [Microsoft NERD Center](http://microsoftnewengland.com).
They're a reliable good venue and amusingly appropriate given that Microsoft is the backing company behind TypeScript.

Whatever venue you choose, I strongly recommend always booking several months ahead and gong out of your way to be a good partner.
Clean up after yourself, be polite to the staff, and don't give them a hard time over email.

## Assorted Tips

good question... I'd say it's a bunch of hours a week for the month leading up to each meetup. We currently have these roles filled by 1 person each in Boston TS Club:
Director (me): takes notes; bugs people if they don't do their things; mucks around in the Notion; backup when others are out
Design: assets for social media, merchandise such as shirts, spot requests
Operations: sets up recordings of each meetup, generally manages A/V
Outreach: finds to prospective speakers, onboards them, preps them for each meetup
Social media: posts every 1-2 weeks on >=5 platforms
Website: updates the website 2-4 times a month
Things we also do that we need more help with:
Sponsorships: reaching out to companies; figuring out the sponsorship prospectus / tiers
Community: managing the Discord and helping folks feel more comfortable
...I'm probably forgetting some stuff. But this all must be done for a successful meetup.
So that really brings up three parts of an answer:
The raw amount of work is all of that, many hours per week. Doable in isolation, but...
Cooperation: you need to get people on board with you. Which is HARD. A good meetup IMO needs at least 3 people working part-time on it to be sustainable
Longevity: coordinating all this over months and months is surprisingly draining. I'm already burned out and it's barely been a year. How long do you want to keep the meetup up?

Maybe also useful information:We're lucky that the venue is free+reliable.
We haven't had a code of conduct violation yet (🤞) but even without that, the stress of taking this on is pretty intense the first few meetups. I'm normally a very low stress person but the first 2-3 meetups in particular really freaked me out!

## Recognition

A huge _thank you!_ to Joe Woods for taking me on as a team member of [Philly JS Club](https://phillyjs.com) and helping me learn the ropes there.
Philly JS is a great meetup and I miss getting to work with Joe and the rest of the crew.
In my time that was Cody Lewis, Chasen Stark, Rasha Moumneh, and Matt Brophy.

Additional thanks to [Tyler](https://tylur.dev) for prompting this article and for a good discussion on local developer meetups.

My heartfelt appreciation to all the active Boston TS Club organizers: Hadley, Jeremie, Sean, and Xavier.
Plus [David Blass](https://github.com/ssalbdivad) for pitching in a bunch in the beginning.
Boston TS Club would not exist without you all!

[^x]:
    We really, _really_ dislike posting on X (formerly Twitter).
    X has been more and more of a dumpster fire since Elon Musk took over and tilted it into a cesspool of misinformation and weird alt-right ideas.
    But, it's still a very popular platform and we need to be there to reach our audience.
    We look forward to the day when we can stop posting there without risking our own meetup's existence.
